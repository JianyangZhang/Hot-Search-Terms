Video 1: Complex numbers are AWESOME
Where are we going?

View this lesson on YouTube [1] •	 We will learn about a new kind of number known as a “complex number”. •	 We will discover the basic properties of complex numbers and investigate some of their mathematical applications. Complex numbers rest on the idea of the “imaginary unit” i, which is dened via

i=

√

−1

with i satisfying the equation

i2 = −1.
Even though the thought of i may seem crazy, we will see that is a really useful idea.

What is a complex number?

1.1.2	

Why are complex numbers AWESOME?

There are at least two reasons why complex numbers are AWESOME:1.	 their real-world applications; 2.	 their ability to SIMPLIFY mathematics. For example, i arises in the solutions

x(t) = ei

√

k/m t

and x(t) = e−i

√

k/m t

.

to a basic spring-mass dierential equation

d2 x m 2 + kx = 0 dt
where: x = x(t) is the position of the mass at time t; m > 0 is the mass; and k > 0 is the stiffness of the spring. Also, i appears in Fourier transform techniques, which are important for solving partial dierential equations from science and engineering. Complex numbers are AWESOME because they provide a SIMPLER framework from which we can view and do mathematics. As a result, applying methods involving complex numbers can simplify calculations, removing a lot of the boring and tedious parts of mathematical work. For example, complex numbers provides a quick alternative to integration by parts for something like

e−t cos t dt
and gives easy ways of constructing trig formulae, for example

sin(x + y ) = sin x cos y + cos x sin y cos 2θ = cos2 θ − sin2 θ
so you might never have to remember another trig formula ever again!

Here are some examples of complex numbers:

Important idea (What is a complex number? (Cartesian form)). The Cartesian form of a complex number z is

3 + 2i, 6 − i, −1 − 4i,

−7 + 3i, 2i, −2 − 2i.

x + yi or x + iy
where x and y are both real numbers and i is known as the imaginary unit i = −1 and satises i2 = −1. The number x is called the “real part of z”; while y is called the “imaginary

√

part of z”.

View this lesson on YouTube [3] To add/subtract two complex numbers just add/subtract their corresponding components. Example. If z = 1 + 3i and w = 2 + i then

z + w = (1 + 3i) + (2 + i) = (1 + 2) + (3i + i) = 3 + 4i
and

A geometric interpretation of addition is seen through a simple parallelogram or triangle law.

z − w = (1 + 3i) − (2 + i) = (1 − 2) + (3i − i) = −1 + 2i.

2.3.1	

What is the geometric explanation of multiplication? Example.

Let us consider z = 2i and w = 1 + i in the complex plane. If we compute the distances from z and w to the origin (using Pythagoras) then we see that

|z | = 2,

|w | =

√

2.

Now consider the line segments joining z and w to the origin. If we compute the angles θ1 , θ2 to the postive real axis (using trig) with −π < θk ≤ π then we see

θ1 = π/2,

θ2 = π/4.

Now consider zw = −2 + 2i. We have

√ |zw| = 2 2,

θ3 = 3π/4.

We thus see that |zw | = |z | |w | and θ3 = θ1 + θ2 .

Video 5: How to divide complex numbers

View this lesson on YouTube [5] 2.4.1	 How to divide by a complex number

Division of two complex numbers involves multiplying through by a “factor of one” that turns the denominator into a real number. To do this, we use the “conjugate” of the denominator. Example. If z = 2 + i and w = 3 + 2i then

z 2+i = w 3 + 2i 2 + i 3 − 2i ∗ 3 + 2i 3 − 2i (6 − 2i2 ) + (3i − 4i) = (9 − 4i2 ) + (6i − 6i) 8−i 8 1 −i . = = 13 13 13 =
Observe that the denominator is now real and we can (say) easily plot the complex number z/w . If we interpret division as a kind of multiplication, then the geometric interpretation of division can also be seen through rotation/stretching.

View this lesson on YouTube [7] As we saw when performing division of complex numbers, an idea called the conjugate was applied to simplify the denominator. Let us look at this idea a bit further. Important idea (Complex conjugate). For a complex number z = x + yi we dene and denote the “complex conjugate of z” by

z ¯ = x − yi.
If z = 3 + i then z ¯ = 3 − i. If w = 1 − 2i then w ¯ = −1 + i . ¯ = 1 + 2i. If u = −1 − i then u For any point z in the complex plane, we can geometrically determine z ¯ by re ecting the position of z through the real axis.

Polar trig form

5	 Polar trig form
5.1	 Video 20: Polar trig form of complex number
View this lesson on YouTube [20] Instead of the Cartesian x + yi form, sometimes it is convenient to express complex numbers in other equivalent forms. Using trigonometry in the complex plane we see that we can express any (non-zero) complex number z in the form

z = r(cos θ + i sin θ)
where r is the distance to the origin and θ is the angle to the pos. real axis. Important idea (Formulae for polar trig form). For z = x + yi a polar trig form is z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ) where:

r=

x2 + y 2 = | z | ;

x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, tan θ = y/x.
We denote the angle θ by arg(z) and call arg(z) “an argument of z”. Because cos θ = cos(θ + 2kπ ) and sin θ = sin(θ + 2kπ ) for all integers k , the angle θ associated with a complex number is not unique. For example, if z = 1 + i then we may represent z in polar trig form via

z=
and

√

2(cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4))

z=

√

2(cos(9π/4) + i sin(9π/4)).

Thus, θ = arg(z) is not uniquely determined by z.

6.1	 Video 21: Polar exponential form of a complex number
View this lesson on YouTube [21] Instead of the Cartesian form z = x + yi or the polar trig form z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) sometimes it is convenient for multiplication and solving polynomials to express complex numbers in yet another equivalent form

z = reiθ .
Important idea (Formula for polar exponential form z = reiθ ). For z = x + yi a polar exponential form is z = reiθ where:

r=

x2 + y 2 and tan θ = y/x.

If we combine the polar exponential form with the polar trig form then we obtain a special identity called “Euler’s formula”

eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ
and if θ = π then we obtain the famous formula

eπi = −1.
Because cos θ = cos(θ + 2kπ ) and sin θ = sin(θ + 2kπ ) for all integers k , the angle θ associated with a complex number is not unique. For example, if z = 1 + i then we may represent z in polar trig and polar exp. form via

z=
and

√

2(cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)) =

√

2eiπ/4

z=

√

2(cos(9π/4) + i sin(9π/4)) =

√

2ei9π/4 .

Thus, θ = arg(z) is not uniquely determined by z.

We have formed a dierential equation/initial value problem. Note that g (θ ) := eiθ also satises the IVP. By uniqueness of solutions, f ≡ g , that is,

eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ.
This also means that the polar exponential form reiθ is an accurate representation of any complex number z.

View this lesson on YouTube [38] 10.1.1	 Regions in the complex plane

We can use equations or inequalities to represent regions within two-dimensional space. With a bit of care, we can also represent regions in the complex plane via similar techniques. We know that the modulus |z | of any complex number z is the length of the line segment joining z to the origin. Thus, the set

{z ∈ C : |z | < 3}
is the set of all complex numbers, whose distance to the origin is less than three units. This is an open disc, centred at the origin, with radius three. Similarly, the set

{z ∈ C : |z − (2 + i)| < 3}
is the set of all complex numbers, whose distance to 2 + i is less than three units. This is an open disc, centred at the 2 + i , with radius three. Similarly, the set

{z ∈ C : |z − i| = 3}
is the set of all complex numbers, whose distance to i is exactly three units. This is a circle, centered at the i, with radius three. The set

That is

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative knowhow is crucial to running a large proportion of the world’s wind turbines. Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to maintenance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic lubrication. We help make it more economical to create cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, industries can boost performance beyond expectations. Therefore we need the best employees who can meet this challenge!
