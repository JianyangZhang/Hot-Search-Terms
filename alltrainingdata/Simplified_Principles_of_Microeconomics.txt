Introduction

Introduction
Several years ago a student rushed into my office without any consideration for my work or for the thoughts I had at the time. â€˜Professor I hate economics, I donâ€™t know anything about it. I have to take it for my degree and Iâ€™m scaredâ€™. She sat down on a chair and started sobbing helplessly. Economic subjects are often regarded as â€˜hard, mathematical, full of formulas, dry and boringâ€™. These are some of the descriptions you often hear when you ask students how they first perceive economic subjects. Economics class sizes are shrinking at most universities, and at some universities they have been abandoned altogether. If there are some economics subjects left in business colleges, the curriculum is adjusted to â€˜please the studentsâ€™ rather than to teach them about an important aspect of their daily lives. Why are economics subjects attracting such negative responses from students? Where is the problem? Is it really so hard to comprehend â€˜those two linesâ€™, the two different shapes on a graph, the famous demand and supply curves that can be used to explain almost everything in economics? This book proposes straightforward answers to these questions based on the way the subject is presented. The principles of economic theory have to be explained in terms of everyday activities. Everyday activities are, after all, what economics is all about! Yes, every day we use complicated economic laws without even noticing. This book aims to deal with these problems instead of changing the curriculum in an attempt to please the students. It uses a teaching method that has been proved to work all over the world. Economics is presented in simplified terms with real-life examples. In a few short chapters I shall explain the most important principles of microeconomics in the simplest possible terms. I have taught economics for more than two decades all over the world. In each country, with its distinct culture, customs and languages, my teaching philosophy has been the same: use simplicity, honesty, humour and show respect for differences in the learning styles of students. As the result of this approach, I have received accolades from students and heard many inspirational stories. Finally, here is one real-life example of my teaching approach. It can be described, in a nutshell, as presenting a concept in simple real-life terms, getting students to understand it, then leaving further applications for them to think about.

Introduction

At one university I teach entrepreneurship as part of the economics syllabus. I was asked to talk about creativity. This is how the class went: Before the start of class, I had set the scene by placing objects around the room. There were balls, pieces of paper, paints, a saxophone, bottles: whatever I had been able to bring from my home. These objects would have appeared to be strategically placed but in fact they were in no particular order. The students seemed puzzled at the scene but they were making no comments when I entered the room. I introduced myself, then sat quietly at the desk apparently minding my own business, reading and making notes. During this time I was actually taking notes on what was happening in the class. During the first five minutes, the students were quiet, a bit confused about what was happening, expecting at every moment that I would start telling them how to be creative. During the next ten minutes, the students began to give up on me. They started texting under the desk, writing notes or checking their schedule for the next class. Overall they remained well behaved. During the rest of the time, the students found things to do with the objects that were scattered around the room. A few were painting; some sketched; a few were making paper planes, cutting coloured paper and gluing; some tried to play the saxophone; one student drew cartoon characters. In short, the students did whatever they liked, paying no attention to my presence whatsoever. At the end of the class I stood up and said â€˜Thank you very much for your work. That was our class on creativity.â€™ The students turned around, putting aside whatever they were doing, and applauded. Later, of course, I spoke to them about practicalities, but not about creativity itself. (How could you teach anyone to be creative or to think?) Instead, I gave the students practical strategies to enable alternative thinking, to make themselves ready for an epiphany, to use technology, to follow their dreams, to establish a business and to employ people. Finally, I spoke to them about the five basic principles of economics to apply when establishing and running a business: the five principles discussed in this book.

The structure of this book

1	 The structure of this book
This book is divided into three parts. PartÂ 1 is the foundation for the main body of the book. It provides the visual vocabulary for the rest of the book. PartÂ 2 is the core of the book. It deals with five essential principles of microeconomics. PartÂ 3 contains a summary and the reference material. Part 1 The chapter â€˜Those two linesâ€™ explains a few basic concepts and how they are portrayed with one or two lines on a graph. Part 2 The first chapter in PartÂ  2 discusses The First Principle: the economic fact of life that â€˜we canâ€™t have everything we wantâ€™. The next chapter, The Second Principle, deals with desires and availability, the economics of demand and supply. In the chapter on The Third Principle you will learn how to measure how our desires respond to changes in prices. The Fourth Principle will take you to the marketplace where those who want a product or service negotiate with those who produce or provide it. The final chapter on The Fifth Principle examines the types of costs we have to pay to produce something. In each chapter I first list the objectives of that chapter and what you will get out of it. Then I discuss the topic in simple terms, providing real-life examples. I also include exercises or questions you will need to increase your understanding of the topic. These few chapters will enable you to understand the basics of economics. They will provide a solid foundation for further studies in economics if you ever need to take a more comprehensive course. Part 3 PartÂ 3 contains some handy reference material: the bibliography is a list of useful textbooks; the answers allow you to check your work after you have attempted the exercises in the text; the glossary explains some words that are frequently used in economics.

How to read this book

2	 How to read this book
Start by studying â€˜Those two linesâ€™ in the first chapter. Do not worry at this stage if there is something that does not make sense to you. Everything will become clearer as you study the five basic principles in PartÂ 2 of the book. From time to time, as you progress through the rest of the book, come back to review the chapter on â€˜Those two linesâ€™. Throughout the book I suggest various activities for you to try. Be sure to make an honest attempt at each of these activities. Write down your answers, then compare your written answers with the answers at the end of the book. You will find many new words and phrases in this book, and also words and phrases that have special meanings in economics. I shall give you an careful explanation of each of these terms as it arises. Do not worry if you cannot remember everything the first time. On the other hand, if you are not sure of the meaning of a term, do not ignore it: check in the glossary at the end of this book, look it up in a dictionary or search for it on line. In some chapters I shall expand the discussion to round out the topic and perhaps also satisfy your curiosity. These extra sections are indicated by |a border around the text|. You may chose to skip the extra sections and focus only on the main body of the chapter. You will be equipped to study the later chapters, even without the extra material.

3	 Those two lines
3.1	 Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter you will know â€¢	 how economists present many concepts using a single graph â€¢	 how the different directions of the lines on the graph explain different relationships â€¢	 how to draw a graph from a set of data. As I mentioned in the introduction, economics is about everyday activities. Everything in life has two sides to it, so too everything in economics has two sides: black-white, increase-decrease, birth-death, together-separate, head-tail and so on. Most concepts in economics can be represented by one or two lines. Economists are both rational and practical people so these lines are very useful tools for explaining certain relationships.

Those two lines

Consider an example. Picture a marketplace where a seller and a buyer are negotiating. For example, you could picture a vendor at a fruit market who has apples and a customer who wants to buy apples. Instead of just talking about prices and quantities, economists draw two intersecting lines. These lines represent the relationship between price and quantity. They are drawn in the area bordered by two axes.

Figure 1

Economists use the convention that quantity, Q, is presented on the horizontal axis and price, P, is presented on the vertical axis. Quantities are shown in an appropriate unit such as kilograms for apples. Prices are shown in monetary units, for example dollars, pounds or euros. The point of intersection of these lines is called the equilibrium point. This is where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. I want to show how a change in the price of apples corresponds to a change in the quantity of the apples the customer is willing to buy, so I need some data. TableÂ 1 lists imaginary price and quantity data for the customer.
Quantities in kg Q 1 2 3 4 5 6
Table 1

Prices in $ P 6 5 4 3 2 1

I can now mark these numbers on the axes and connect related numbers: Q=1Â &Â P=6; Q =2 & P=5; and so on. In doing so I draw the black line showing the relationship between price and quantity.

Figure 2

When there is a decrease in the price of apples, there is increase in the quantity the customer will buy. The variables price and quantity go in opposite directions, as one increases the other decreases, so their relationship is called an inverse relationship or a negative relationship. I use these terms interchangeably. (In other books, you may also see the terms opposite relationship and indirect relationship.) A defining characteristic of economics is that it is a scientific study of the behaviour of a typical, rational person. The black line shows how such a person behaves. When the price of a product decreases they buy more of it, the quantity demanded increases. Such a line in economics is called a demand curve. It does not have to be a straight line, as it is in Figure 2; it could be a curved or broken shape, as you will see when you get to Your Turn at the end of this chapter. Until now I have been talking about the behaviour of people who want a product or service and their willingness to pay a certain price for a certain quantity, the relationship between price and quantity. Furthermore, I have illustrated the inverse relationship with the black line in FigureÂ  2: it is going downwards; a customer is willing to buy more when the price is lower. Remember, in economics you always have to consider two sides to any argument. So now, instead of thinking about the customerâ€™s point of view, consider the seller of a product or service. Imagine yourself as a seller. How would you react to a change in price? Yes, exactly the opposite: the higher the price, the more you are willing to sell and, vice versa, the lower the price the less you are willing to sell.

Those two lines

Reminder We can present everything in economics by a line or two on a graph. The line for the seller will look different from the line for the customer. The new line will show the opposite behaviour of a seller. Again I need some imaginary data, which I shall plot on another graph.
Quantities in kg Q 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
Table 2

Prices in $ P 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

From TableÂ 2, you can see how a seller is happier when prices increase and is willing to sell more of the product with each increase in price. Again I take the numbers from the table and mark them on the axes. Then I connect related numbers: Q=1 & P=1; Q=2 & P=2; and so on. In doing so I draw the blue line in Figure 3 showing the relationship between price and quantity. When the price of a product is increased, the quantity supplied is increased. Since the variables price and quantity are going in same direction, such a relationship is called a direct relationship or a positive relationship.

Figure 3

The blue line in FigureÂ 3 shows how sellers behave. When the price of a product increases they offer more of the product for sale, the quantity supplied increases. Such a line in economics is called a supply curve. It does not have to be a straight line; it could be a curved or broken shape, as you will see when you do the exercises at the end of this chapter.

That completes the story about the black and blue lines and how you can draw them to illustrate the behaviour of customers and suppliers. It completes the first stage of your journey towards an understanding of Simplified principles of microeconomics. Now it is time for you to do a few exercises and answer a few questions to increase your understanding of the topics I have covered so far. Your Turn Draw the graph based on these numbers:
Prices in $ P 2 3 4 6 9 Quantities in kg Q 3 5.5 6.5 7.5 8

Questions 1.	 Explain in your own words what economics is about. 2.	 Which type of relationship does the black line in FigureÂ 2 represent? 3.	 What does vice versa mean? And why am I asking this question in book about economics? 4.	 Look carefully at these diagrams:

Figure 4

a)	 Which of these graphs1 shows a negative relationship? b)	 Which of these figures show a quantity that remains unchanged even when the price changes? c)	 In which of these diagrams is the Q-P relationship positive rather then negative?

Exercise Choose a product that is on sale at your local supermarket or on a website. Collect data about the prices and quantities of this product. Draw a graph depicting their relationship. Tips â€¢	 When you use graphs, always label them properly. Give each graph a title and label the axes appropriately. Interpreting a graph without labels is like trying to find a can of beans on a shelf full of unlabelled cans. â€¢	 Reading a graph should be as easy as reading text. â€¢	 Plotting a point on a graph is a straightforward process. Starting from 0 on each axis, find the point on the axis that corresponds to the given value, then follow straight lines from each of these points into the space bordered by the axes until the lines meet. For example, to find the point where Q=5 & P=7: on the QÂ axis find 5; on PÂ axis find 7; imagine a straight line going vertically from 5 on Q; imagine a straight line going horizontally from 7 on P; find the point where these two lines meet. Further reading Look up one of the books in the bibliography or find any substantial economics textbook. You are sure to find a chapter on graphs near the beginning of the book. There are millions of websites dealing with graphs in economics. Search for â€˜graphs in economicsâ€™ and follow some of the links.

4.1	 Learning objectives
After studying this chapter you will be able to â€¢	 use one of the most important concepts in economics: opportunity costs â€¢	 recognise the opportunity costs of your actions â€¢	 illustrate opportunity costs on a graph Why canâ€™t we have everything that we want? The answer to this question is very simple: there are not enough resources to satisfy everyoneâ€™s desires. In other words, human desires may be unlimited but resources are not.

Simplified Principles of Microeconomics

The First Principle: we canâ€™t have everything we want

This is a fact of life. There are not enough resources for everybody to have everything they want; we have to make trade-offs. That is, we usually have to make some sacrifices and choose one thing over another. For example, I would like to have a small car for around the city and another car for long distances, but I cannot afford two cars. Which one should I choose? Well, most of the time I use my car to travel around town. Therefore I will choose a small town car and do without a bigger car that would have been more convenient for long distances. You have probably experienced numerous situations where you had to choose one product or one service over another. Perhaps you chose an iPhone instead of a Samsung, or an exotic holiday instead of deposit for a house, or one perfume instead of another, or you put money into a savings account to earn interest instead of investing it in a business venture. I am sure you can think of lots of examples. When you think like an economists, you make choices by considering both the costs and benefits of each action, and then you chose the alternative that leaves you better off. You will always make sure that the benefits of your choice are greater than costs. For example, if a shop 10Â km away is offering a discount on the new iPad, you may decide not to buy one at a local shop after you have worked out that the cost of travelling 20Â km is less than the discount. But there is a catch! When you choose one product over another, you face not only the obvious, direct cost of that choice but also an indirect cost, the value of the missed opportunity. When you choose one product over another, along with the price of that product, you also incur the costs of missing out on the product you sacrificed. For example, if I choose to invest my money in property instead of depositing it in the bank to earn interest, apart from the price of that property, I also incurred the cost of the lost interest. And, vice versa, if I deposit money in a bank instead of buying a property, the costs of earning the interest would be the missing value of having a property in my portfolio. Another example would be if I have chosen an iPhone over a Samsung smart phone, the cost of having an iPhone includes the missing value of having a Samsung smart phone. So, when you choose one thing instead of something else, you effectively incur costs which can be expressed as the value of the missed opportunity, the value you would have had if you had chosen the alternative. These costs are called opportunity costs. They may also be called implicit costs in contrast to the out of pocket expenses, the tangible costs, which are called explicit costs. Opportunity costs are unique to economics. By contrast, an accountant will only recognise explicit costs.

The First Principle: we canâ€™t have everything we want

More examples: â€¢	 Suppose I choose to buy a PC for $800. The opportunity costs of having the PC is the value of something else I could have used the $800 for. If the second best choice was to deposit $800 in a savings account, the opportunity costs of the PC would be the interest I would have earned on the $800 but did not. â€¢	 If I was not writing this chapter, I would be spending time with my family. The opportunity costs of writing this chapter is the time with my family that I have sacrificed. â€¢	 If I had wanted to sleep in this morning, the opportunity costs of writing this chapter would have been an hour or two of missed sleep. In short, every choice in life has opportunity costs. The worldâ€™s resources are limited, so individuals, firms and governments have to make choices about what to have, what to produce and what to fund. Every decisions involves the sacrifice of the benefits of an alternative that was not chosen. Often there are no direct outlays associated with the opportunity costs of a decision. Opportunity costs do not have to be expressed in monetary units, they may be express terms of time, satisfaction or other values. Your Turn What are your opportunity costs if you are stuck in a traffic jam on a motorway for an hour on your way to work? Questions 1.	 What is the opportunity cost of spending an hour reading this chapter, if the best alternative would be to earn income at $100 per hour? 2.	 If a company is capable of producing ProductÂ A and ProductÂ B, what are the opportunity costs for the company if it uses all its resources to produce ProductÂ A? 3.	 Suppose you have spent three hours searching for a new laptop and found the lowest price is $300. What are your explicit and implicit costs of buying that new laptop? Case 1 The government was tossing up between building a new hospital and buying a new ship for the navy. They do not have enough money in the budget for both, so they had to choose which project to fund. After long discussions and a vote in parliament, they have decided, by majority vote, to buy a new ship for the navy. a)	 What did the government sacrificed to buy the new ship for the navy? b)	 What could the government have done instead of buying the ship? c)	 What was the best alternative to buying a ship for the navy? d)	 What are the opportunity costs of the ship?

Simplified Principles of Microeconomics

The First Principle: we canâ€™t have everything we want

Reminder Earlier I said that in economics we can illustrate concepts by one or two lines in the space bordered by horizontal and vertical axes (see FigureÂ 1 in the previous chapter). Reminder Economists are rational people, simple people (I know you are laughing now) and practical people so, whenever they can, they use graphs and other shortcuts as tools to explain concepts. Economists call these tools economic models. Economic models simplify reality by including assumptions. For example, if I want to talk about opportunity costs, I shall assume that everything else is held constant and that there is a choice between only two products. In reality, you would have to choose between lots of different products and services, but reducing it to only two products make the discussion simpler. Instead of saying â€˜while everything else is held constantâ€™ in an economic model, economist will often use the phrase ceteris paribus. I have it in mind every time I give you an example. To make the economic principles clear, I change one thing at a time, ceteris paribus. Be careful: I shall not say ceteris paribus again, you will have to say it to yourself every time I give you an example. Reminder Resources are limited, so you frequently have to chose one alternative over another and therefore encounter opportunity costs. I shall illustrate this statement with a single line on a graph. It is like the lines in FigureÂ 2 in the previous chapter, but this time it uses a different coordinate system. Instead of P and Q, the axes represent the quantities A and B of two alternative products.

Simplified Principles of Microeconomics

The First Principle: we canâ€™t have everything we want

In this economic model I shall assume that there are only two alternatives: ProductÂ A and ProductÂ B. The model illustrates the trade-offs when choosing one of these products instead the another. For example, if I chose to have 7 of ProductÂ A, I cannot chose any of ProductÂ B, as you can see from the point A=7 & B=0 (and vice versa, as you can see from the point A=0 & B=7). However there are some combinations of the two products that I could chose. For example, I could choose a combination of 4 of ProductÂ A and 3 of ProductÂ B, as you can see from PointÂ F (A=4 & B=3). FigureÂ 5 shows all the possible combinations, from PointÂ C to PointÂ H on the black line: A=1 & B=6, A=2 & B=5 and so on. In addition, the black line illustrates the results of a scarcity of resources; it shows the trade-offs that the scarcity entails; it shows the opportunity costs. By choosing to have ProductÂ A, I have to sacrifice ProductÂ B. If I want to have seven ProductÂ A, I have to sacrifice seven ProductÂ B and vice versa. Moreover, every increase of one ProductÂ  A entails a corresponding sacrifice of one ProductÂ  B.2 In other words, the opportunity cost of having one ProductÂ A is sacrificing one ProductÂ B. The opportunity cost in this example is 1. Because of the quantities of these two products have an inverse relationship, the black line slopes downwards, which means that when either product is increased the other is decreased. Not only does any increase in ProductÂ A entail a sacrifice of ProductÂ B but also, vice versa, any increase in ProductÂ B entails a sacrifice of ProductÂ A, as you can see as you move upwards on the black line, for example from PointÂ D to PointÂ C. Questions Questions 4 to 8 refer to FigureÂ 5 4.	 What are the opportunity costs of having ProductÂ A? 5.	 What are the opportunity costs of having ProductÂ B? 6.	 What are the opportunity costs of having one less of ProductÂ B? 7.	 What are the opportunity costs of having one additional ProductÂ A? 8.	 At the combination illustrated by PointÂ G, how much would it costs to have five ProductÂ A? Reminder Each concept in economics has two sides. So far I have considered things from the customerâ€™s point of view. I have shown how customers face trade-offs and therefore face opportunity costs. However, the same concept applies to companies and governments when they act as suppliers.

I shall illustrate the opportunity costs of a supplier using the same diagram (FigureÂ 5), but first I need to adjust my assumptions. Instead of talking about a customer acquiring one product or another, I shall consider a firm that has to choose which combination of products to produce with the limited resources it has available.

The next change is that the black line is now called the production possibility frontier or PPF curve. The PPF curve shows how much of a product it is possible to produce with the available resources. The firm can produce seven ProductÂ A and no ProductÂ B, or no ProductÂ A and seven ProductÂ B, or any other combination represented by the points C to H.3 Any government, too, has to face limits to its resources. It has to choose which products to acquire, for example a navy ship or a hospital. In this case it is acting as a customer. It also has to chose which projects to fund, for example infrastructure or public goods, in which case it is acting as a supplier.

4.2	Challenge
In the previous example, opportunity costs were constant (at 1). What would the PPF curve look like if there were increasing opportunity costs? Use the data in TableÂ 3 to draw the PPF curve.

4.3	Summary
In this chapter I illustrated one of the facts of life: we cannot have everything we want because of there limited resources. Limited or scarce resources force us to make a choice about which products and services to acquire and which to sacrifice. Each time we make a choices, we incur implicit costs, which in economics are called opportunity costs. These are the costs of the foregone alternative. Finally, I have shown that not only customers encounter scarcity but also firms and governments.

The demand side of the market

Economics is all about understanding how incentives and disincentives affect typical human behaviour, how economic humans might behave in an everyday situation. Suppose you have been buying one 300Â ml bottle of water for $6 every day. One morning you find that the price has gone down to $5, so you are enticed to buy two bottles. The next morning the price of water goes down to $4 and you are tempted to buy three bottles. As the price goes down even further, you buy more and more, as you can see in TableÂ 4. Finally, when the price goes down to $1 you buy six bottles.4
Prices in $ P 6 5 4 3 2 1
Table 4: demand schedule

Quantities in units Q 1 2 3 4 5 6

Now think about it the other way round. Every day you have been buying six 300Â ml bottles of water for $1 each. One morning you find the price has gone up to $2, so you are only willing to buy five bottles. The next morning the price goes up to $3 and you decide you can only afford four bottles at that price. For the sake of argument again, suppose the price goes up to $4 and you buy three bottles; when the price is $5 you buy two bottles. Finally, when the price reaches $6 you buy one only bottle.

As you know by now, you can illustrate this behaviour as a line on a graph. Whenever you can replace human judgement by a formula or a graph, you should at least consider it (Kahneman, 2012, p. 233). The numbers for you as a customer (TableÂ 4) just happen to be the same as those for the supplier I discussed in the previous chapter (FigureÂ 5), but in this case the axes represent Quantity, Q, and Price, P, instead of ProductÂ A, and ProductÂ B.

Figure 6

A move downwards towards 0 on the PÂ  axis in FigureÂ 6 is equivalent to a reduction in the price. You can see that if the price goes down the customer is enticed to buy more of the product and, vice versa, if the price goes up the customer will reduce the quantity demanded. As always, I connect the related Q and P points: PointÂ C (Q=1 & P=6), PointÂ D (Q=2 & P=5) and so on. The resulting black line is the demand curve. This demand curve shows how a typical, rational customer would behave in the market situation I described above. The curve is downward sloping, which indicates an inverse relationship between the price and quantity . Questions Questions 1â€“4 are based on FigureÂ 6, which illustrates your willingness to pay for a certain item. 1.	 How much you are willing to pay for three items? 2.	 If the price is $3, how many items will you buy? 3.	 How many items would you take if they were free? 4.	 If the price is $7, how many items would you buy?

To summarise, when the price goes down you are more willing to buy more of a product and, vice versa, when the price goes up you reduce the quantity you demand.

So far I have discussed the behaviour of a customer when the price of the product changes. In FigureÂ 6, the demand curve shows that when the price changes the quantity demanded changes in the opposite direction. For example, going down the demand curve from PointÂ C to PointÂ D, you can see that when the price goes down from $6 to $5, the quantity demanded goes up from one unit to two units. Going in the opposite direction from PointÂ F to PointÂ E, you can see that when the price goes up from $3 to $4, the quantity demanded goes down from four units to three units.

Figure 7: demand for Coke

PointÂ F, for example, shows that you are willing to buy four cans of Coke at $3 each. If the price changes upwards, the quantity demanded goes down and vice versa, which is seen as movement along the demand curve. There is nothing new so far, but now things get a bit more complicatedâ€¦ You notice that the price of a can of Pepsi in the same market is $1.50. For the price of one can of Coke you could get two cans of Pepsi. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that you will reduce your demand for Coke. (No, I did not say â€˜quantity demandedâ€™; I was talking about the demand itself, and you will see why in a moment.) I assume here that you are one of a number of customers. I also assume that customers do not have a preference for one brand over the other, in which case the alternative product, Pepsi, is call a substitute. With these assumptions I can say that customers will buy cans of Coke only when the substitute, Pepsi, is not available at a lower price. What will happen to the demand curve in this case? Instead of moving along the curve to indicate a change in price, I have to change the demand curve itself to show the change in demand.

Figure 8: shifts in demand for Coke

The dotted black line in FigureÂ 8 is the original demand curve for Coke. The solid red line shows the new, reduced demand for Coke when the alternative, Pepsi, is cheaper. The solid green line shows the opposite case when a can of Pepsi costs $3 and a can of Coke costs $1.50, and there is a corresponding increase in the demand for Coke. This example shows that non-price factors can cause a shift in the demand curve. Non-price factors are everything except the price of the product itself, they may include the price of substitutes, customer preferences, income, the number of customers, climate change and many other influences.

The Second Principle: desire versus availability

Availability: the supply side of the market Earlier I talked about customers; in this section I shall switch to thinking as a supplier. In any market, supply represents the other side of the coin to demand. You will find it much easier to master the discussion of supply if you have already mastered the demand side. To understand the supply side, you take almost everything you learnt about the demand side and turn it upside down. You have already seen how customers dislike price increases and how this dislike is reflected in reductions in the quantity demanded. On the other hand, suppliers like to see an increase in the price of their product, and their liking is reflected in an increase in the quantity supplied. When the price of a product goes up, more of that product is made available in the market. Example Now suppose you have been selling one 300Â ml bottle of water for $1 every day. One morning you find that the price has gone up to $2, so you are enticed to sell two bottles. The next morning the price of water goes up to $3 and you are tempted to sell three bottles. As the price goes up even further, you offer more and more for sale, as you can see in TableÂ 5. Finally, when the price goes up to $6 you sell six bottles.5
Prices in $ P 1 2 3 4 5 6

Quantities in units Q 1 2 3 4 5 6

In short, when the price of a product goes up, you are willing to supply more of it and, vice versa, when the price goes down you are willing to supply less. Remember Whenever you can replace human judgement by a formula or a graph, you should at least consider it (Kahneman, 2012, p. 233). With that advice in mind, I shall plot the data from TableÂ 5 on a graph.

The blue line in FigureÂ 9 shows how you behave as a supplier. Such a line in economics is called a supply curve. When the price increases you offer more for sale, the quantity supplied increases.

Suppliers have to decide how many products they are willing to supply at any given market price. These decisions are represented by the points on the supply curve. As you can see from the blue line in FigureÂ 9, when the price is $1 you are willing to supply 1 unit of the product to the market, but if the price is increased to $2 you will supply 2 units of the product and so on. Remember â€¢	 When the price of the product or service changes the QUANTITY SUPPLIED changes in the same direction, which is illustrated by MOVEMENT ALONG the supply curve. â€¢	 When you observe a movement up or down the supply curve, you know there is a change in the quantity supplied. â€¢	 When a change in the price of a product causes a change in the quantity supplied, it results in a movement along the supply curve.

So far I have only discussed the behaviour of suppliers when there is a change in the price of the product itself. I shall now consider what else might affect your willingness to supply a particular product or service. â€¢	 You may have noticed a number of suppliers of the same product, not just your company. If there are more firms producing the same or similar products, there may be an oversupply in the market. In this case, increased competition may cause you to reduce supply. â€¢	 In the current digital age, new technology is being introduced to enable cheaper production methods. Lower production costs for product will increase the supply of that product. For example, new software used to be delivered on a CD or DVD. I am sure you remember that. Now software licences are offered on line and new software is downloaded directly to your computer, tablet or smart phone. This cuts the supplierâ€™s production costs, increases productivity and increases supply. â€¢	 Reductions in the supplierâ€™s input costs also increase supply. â€¢	 The expectations of suppliers can also affect supply. For example, if news of a new version of Appleâ€™s iPhone is leaked to the media, Samsung might reduce the price of their smart phones to increase their sales before the new iPhone is released. What would happen to your supply curve in FigureÂ 9 in any of these cases? The supply will be increased or decreased depending which of these factor apply and how they influence supply.

Figure 10: shifts in supply

In FigureÂ 10 the dashed blue line is the original supply curve and the solid red line represents a new, reduced supply. This reduction in supply could have been caused by increased competition or by increased input prices making the production more expensive. The solid green line represents a new, increased supply. An increase in supply could have been caused by reduced input prices or by increased productivity. Non-price factors can cause a shift in the supply curve. Non-price factors are everything except the price of the product itself, they may include the number of suppliers, technological advances, input prices, taxes, supplier expectations and many other influences.

6.1	 Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter you will know how to â€¢	 use the concept elasticity of demand â€¢	 measure customersâ€™ responsiveness to price changes â€¢	 differentiate between elasticity of demand, elasticity of supply and elasticity of income. In the previous chapter you saw how customers and suppliers react when the price of a product changes and also how they respond to other factors. You saw that customers react negatively to price increases but suppliers react positively to price increases. When the price increases, customers reduce the quantity demanded but suppliers increase the quantity supplied. The relationship between price and quantity is negative for customers and positive for suppliers.

The Third Principle: measuring responses

Sometimes you will need to measure the magnitude of these responses. For example, as a companyâ€™s senior economist you may be asked to prepare a report on whether to increase or decrease the price of a product in order to increase the companyâ€™s revenue. Unless you know how to measure the magnitude of customer responses, you can only guess which way to adjust the price. You know that customers react negatively to an increased price, so if you increase the price some of your customers will switch to the competition. In this case you might decrease the companyâ€™s revenue instead of increasing it. In contrast, if you decrease the price you will get more customers to buy your product, but an increased customer base may not be enough to offset the decrease in price. In that case, too, you might decrease the company revenue. You need to know how to make accurate measurements of customer responses to changes in price.

6.2	

Example 1

Every week you buy petrol for your car at $1 per litre. You wake up one Monday morning to the sound of the the radio news and you are immediately worried by an announcement of a 20% increase in the price of petrol. That means the price will now be $1.20 per litre. You could decide to drive only on weekends, reducing your petrol consumption by 15% from the current 100 litres per week. In the opposite situation, if prices go down by 20% to $0.80, would you jump up out of the bed, singing your favourite tune, and calculate how much you will save on petrol every week?

6.3	

Example 2

Every morning you buy a packet of chewing gum for $1. One day you read that the price of a packet is about to go up by 20%. You might react to this news by reducing consumption by 80%. In these examples I have illustrated some possible reactions of a customer to price changes. In the first case, the 15% reduction in consumption was proportionally smaller than the 20% price change; in the second case, the 80% reduction in consumption was drastically larger than the 20% price change. In this section I shall discuss the relative size of changes in the price and in the quantity demanded. In other words I shall examine the percentage by which the quantity demanded falls when the price rises by a certain percentage. Economists use the concept of price elasticity of a product or service to measure sensitivity of quantity demanded. Elasticity is a measure of the proportional change in the quantity demanded compared to the proportional change in price. Algebraically, elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity to the percentage change in price. It is normally expressed as a fraction:

elasticity of demand is in short

percentage change in quantity demanded percentage change in price

where Ed	 %Î”Qd 	 %Î”P	 is the elasticity of demand; is the percentage change in the quantity demanded; is the percentage change in the price.

6.4	

Example 1 again

In the first example, the original price of petrol, P0, was $1.00 and the newÂ price, P1, was $1.20, so

The original quantity of petrol, Q0, was 100Â L and the new quantity, Q1, was 85Â L so

There is a negative relationship between the price and the quantity demanded, which is why there is a negative sign in %Î”qd = -15%. However, economists drop the negative sign when calculating elasticity of demand, so

This means there is a 0.75 percent change in the quantity demanded for each one percent change in the price. In other words, if the price is increased by 1%, the quantity of demand decreases by 0.75%. Economists understand the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded, so they express the elasticity of demand as 0.75, not -0.75.

There is a negative relationship between the price and quantity demanded, which is why there is a negative sign in %Î”Qd = -80%. However, economists drop the negative sign when calculating elasticity of demand, so

The elasticity of demand is four. There is a four percent change in the quantity demanded for each one percent change in the price. In other words, if the price is increased by 1% the quantity of demand decreases by 4%. There is a logic behind dropping the minus sign. Elasticity is a measure of sensitivity to change. Something can be more or less sensitive, or even completely insensitive, but there is no such thing as negative sensitivity. The minus sign would only be there for the sake of mathematical correctness, indicating the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded. From now on I shall drop the negative sign without mentioning it.

Suppose P0 = $1, P1 = $1.20, Q0 = 10 and Q1 = 8. Then

These three values, 0.75, 4 and 1, illustrate three types of price elasticity. If the elasticity is less than one, economists say the demand is inelastic; if the elasticity is greater than one, they say the demand is elastic; if the elasticity is equalÂ toÂ one, they say the demand has unit elasticity.

Going down this line, from left to right, the demand curve displays a range of values for elasticity. From $40 to down to $20, the demand is elastic; at $20 there is unit elasticity; further down, the demand is an inelastic.

The Third Principle: measuring responses

Recall that the price elasticity of demand is a ratio of percentage changes. At the upper end of the demand curve, quantities demanded are lower and prices are higher, so a small percentage change in price can cause a large percentage change in quantity. For example, if the price is increased from $30 to $35, the quantity demanded is reduced from 10 to 5. Putting these numbers into the formula for price elasticity,

confirms that demand is elastic towards the top of the curve. The opposite will happen towards the other end of the curve. A price increase from $5 to $10 would cause a reduction in quantity demanded from 35 to 30. In that case,

Revenue and elasticity

I began this chapter by asking you to imagine that you were advising a firm how to increase its revenue. You have to decide whether to increase or decrease the price of the firmâ€™s product. You now need to apply your knowledge about elasticity of demand to tackle this problem.
48 total amount of money a firm gets The total revenue (or just the revenue) is the from the sale of its products or services. For example, a firm sold 100 units of a Download free eBooks at bookboon.com product at $5 each. To get the revenue from these sales, multiply the quantity sold by the sale price. The total revenue, TR , in this case is $500.

I began this chapter by asking you to imagine that you were advising a firm how to increase its revenue. You have to decide whether to increase or decrease the price of the firmâ€™s product. You now need to apply your knowledge about elasticity of demand to tackle this problem. The total revenue (or just the revenue) is the total amount of money a firm gets from the sale of its products or services. For example, a firm sold 100Â  units of a product at $5 each. To get the revenue from these sales, multiply the quantity sold by the sale price. The total revenue, TR, in this case is $500. TR = P Ã— Q = $5 Ã—100 = $500. To show how revenue can be linked to elasticity, I shall consider three separate cases: elastic demand, inelastic demand and unit elasticity.

Figure 13: elastic demand	

Ed > 1

As you saw earlier, the flatter the demand curve, the more elastic the demand is. In FigureÂ 13, when the price was decreased from $10 to $4, the quantity demanded was increased from 3 to 20.

Comparing these proportional changes, you find that the price is elastic:

The total revenue, TR, is calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by their price, P Ã— Q. In addition, you know from geometry that you get the area of a rectangle by multiplying its height by its width. For example, the area of the rectangle, H, below the curve is calculated as PÂ Ã—Â  Q = 4Â Ã—Â 20 = 80. Therefore the total revenue at any point on the demand curve is equal to the area of the rectangle under the curve at that point. Now compare the revenue at the original price, the area of K, with the revenue at the reduced price, the area of H. The original revenue was PÂ Ã—Â  Q = 10Â Ã—Â 3 = 30 and the new revenue is PÂ Ã— Q = 4Â Ã—Â 20 = 80. Revenue has increased by $50. When demand is elastic, a reduction in the price will result in an increase in the revenue and, vice versa, an increase in the price will result in a decrease in revenue. There is a negative relationship between price and revenue.

Further discussion Before I go any further I need to clarify two points. First, why do you have to use percentages when calculating elasticity? The answer is that elasticity would otherwise be a ratio of two different units of measurement. Price is expressed in monetary units while quantity may be expressed in kilograms, litres, metres or any other convenient unit. It makes sense algebraically for the units in a ratio to be the same. Economists avoid this problem by using percentages to calculate elasticity because a percentage is a unit-less measure.6 Secondly, when you measure a change, you move along the demand curve from the PointÂ A to PointÂ B, but you could also calculate the change by moving in the opposite direction from B to A. One way would represent an increase in price, the other way would represent a decrease in price. The distance on the graph is the same in each case, but the algebraic formula will give a different value for the elasticity. Suppose, for example, that in going from PointÂ A to PointÂ B you observe an increase in price from $5 to $10. This is a 100% increase in price. However, going the other way, a decrease from $10 to $5 its a decrease of 50%. I shall illustrate this anomaly by returning to ExampleÂ 1 where a increase in the price of petrol caused a fall in the quantity demanded. In this example, the original price of petrol, P0, was $1.00 and the new price, P1, was $1.20, so

The original quantity of petrol, Q0, was 100Â L and the new quantity, Q1, was 85Â L so

âˆ´

Going the opposite way, a decrease in the price of petrol caused an increase in the quantity demanded. In this case, the original price of petrol, P0, is $1.20 and the new price, P1, is $1.00, so

The original quantity of petrol, Q0, is 85Â L and the new quantity, Q1, is 100Â L so

âˆ´

As you can see, the price elasticity of demand comes out as 0.75 when you use an increasing price, and that means demand is inelastic. However, when you deal with the same change in the other direction, the price elasticity comes out as 1.06, and that means demand is elastic. To avoid this anomaly and calculate a more precise value for elasticity, you can use average changes in price and quantity. The formula for elasticity becomes

so elasticity of demand is 0.89. This more precise value means that demand for petrol is inelastic.

The Third Principle: measuring responses

Price elasticity of supply Remember there is a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied, in contrast to the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded. The negative relationship between price and quantity demanded means there is always a negative sign in the result when you calculate elasticity of demand, even though economists drop the negative sign. The positive relationship between price and quantity supplied means you always get a positive result when you calculate the price elasticity of supply, so there is no negative sign to drop. Apart from that, the interpretation is very similar. You calculate the elasticity of supply, Es, using the percentage change in the quantity supplied, %Î” Qs. For example

This result means that for each percent increase in price, the quantity supplied would increase by 0.14 percent. And, vice versa, for each 1% decrease in price, the quantity supplied would decrease by 0.14%. Income elasticity The next type of elasticity is a measure of the relationship between the quantity demanded and a customerâ€™s income. Income elasticity, Ei, relates a change in quantity, %Î” Qd, to a change in income, %Î”I, rather than to a change in price:

Elasticity of income can be positive or negative depending on whether there is a positive or negative relationship between quantity and income. It is positive if the quantity demanded increases whenever income increases. In that case the product in question is called a normal product or a normal good7. Otherwise, if the quantity decreases whenever income increases, the elasticity of income is negative and the product is called an inferior product or an inferior good. Cross price elasticity The last type of elasticity I shall mention is cross price elasticity. It is like the price elasticity of demand except that it considers the changes in the quantity demanded of one product in response to changes in the price of another product. Cross price elasticity, Ec, is the ratio of the percentage change in the quantity of ProductÂ  1, %Î”Q1, to the percentage change in the price of ProductÂ 2, %Î”P2:

For each one percent change in the price of ProductÂ 1, the quantity demanded of ProductÂ 2 changes by Ec percent. For example, suppose

This means that for each 7% increase in the price of Coke the quantity demanded of Pepsi increases by 1%, or for each 1% increase in the price of Coke, the quantity demanded of Pepsi increases by 0.14%. In cross price elasticity, the sign of the calculated result is very important. A positive value for Ec indicates a positive relationship between Q1 and P2; a negative value indicates a negative relationship. If their cross price elasticity is positive, products are called substitutes; if their cross price elasticity is negative, products are called complements. In the previous example cross price elasticity was 0.14, which is positive, so Coke and Pepsi are substitute products. If you calculate the cross price elasticity of coffee and sugar it might come out as a negative number because coffee and sugar go together. In that case coffee and sugar would be classified as complementary products.

7	 The Fourth Principle: negotiations
7.1	 Learning objectives
After studying this chapter you will know how to â€¢	 make use of the concepts market and market forces â€¢	 recognise the point where demand and supply quantities are equal â€¢	 identify different market structures Until now I have discussed each of â€˜Those two linesâ€™ separately: demand and supply. In this chapter I shall bring them together. Using demand and supply together, you can illustrate how markets work efficiently, and you can apply economic theory to many areas of the real life. First I shall describe markets and market forces. Then I shall bring them together in a balance of demand and supply.

Competitive markets

Markets are places where customers meet suppliers. These are not only physical places like the local fresh food market or the local stock exchange but also cyberspace markets like eBay or NASDAQ. The behaviour of customers in a market is represented by the demand curve and the behaviour of suppliers is represented by the supply curve. A competitive market is one where customers and suppliers negotiate the price and quantity based on their respective goals, free from coercion and outside interference. Suppliers want to sell their product at the highest possible price, while customers want to buy the product at the lowest possible price. When these two opposing market forces meet, buyer and seller have to negotiate until they agree on a price and a quantity. In other words, they have to find the price and the quantity at which both the customer is willing to buy and the supplier is willing to sell. These agreed figures are called the market clearing price and the market clearing quantity. In short, they have to negotiate until the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal. This is represented by the equilibrium point on the graph, the point of intersection of the demand and supply curves.

Example 1

Imagine you are at a fairground where, apart from the usual fun activities, there is a tug-of-war. On one side there are customers and on the other side there are suppliers. Each side is trying to pull the other over a line in the middle. After several attempts by each side to overpower the other, they settle at one point where neither side can pull the other any further. At that point they have equal strength, they are in balance, they are at the point of equilibrium.

Example 2

One morning you want to buy a kilo of tomatoes from a supplier at the local fresh produce market. The ticket price is $6 per kilogram but you think the price is too high. You negotiate a price reduction which the supplier will accept, but the supplier will only accept it if you agree to buy more tomatoes. You settle on a price of $3.50 per kilo for 3.5Â kg of fresh tomatoes. Because you and the supplier have reached the point of equilibrium, these are the market clearing price and the market clearing quantity for tomatoes on this occasion. FigureÂ  16 shows this market negotiation process graphically by plotting demand and supply curves together in one coordinate system.

The market price for tomatoes started at $6 per kilo and, at that price, there were 6Â kg of tomatoes on offer. This is the quantity supplied at PointÂ B. However, at that price there was only demand for one kilo of tomatoes, the quantity demanded at PointÂ A. The quantity supplied was greater than the quantity demanded. At $6 per kilo there was a surplus of 5Â kg of tomatoes, which is represented by the distance from PointÂ A to PointÂ B. Later the price was reduced to $5. At this price suppliers were willing to supply 5Â kg but there was still an oversupply of tomatoes. There was a surplus of 3Â kg which is represented by the distance from PointÂ C to PointÂ  F.8 Further negotiations lead to the next iteration of the price: $4 per kilo with 4Â  kg as the quantity supplied. Finally the customers and suppliers settled on a price of $3.50 and a quantity of 3.5Â kg where the quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. They reached the point of equilibrium. Now imagine that things had gone in the opposite direction. Suppose the morning started with a market price of $1 per kilo. At that price there was 1Â kg of tomatoes on offer, the quantity supplied at PointÂ G. At that price there was a demand for 6Â kg of tomatoes, the quantity demanded at PointÂ H. The quantity supplied was less than the quantity demanded. At $1 per kilo there was a shortage of 5Â kg of tomatoes, which is represented by the distance from PointÂ G to PointÂ H.

Later the price was increased to $2, at which price suppliers were willing to supply 2Â kg, but the quantity demanded was 5Â kg, so there was a shortage of 3Â kg, which is represented by the distance from PointÂ I to PointÂ J. Further negotiations lead to the next iteration: a price of $3 and a quantity demanded of 4Â kg. Finally the customers and suppliers settled on a price of $3.50 and a quantity of 3.5Â kg where the quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. They reached the point of equilibrium.

7.5	Summary
â€¢	 The market worked well in this example, getting suppliers and customers to the most efficient outcome, where the market clearing price and the quantity were established at the equilibrium point. â€¢	 Negotiations in the market lead to the establishment of the equilibrium point where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal. â€¢	 Price changes caused movement along the demand and supply curves, â€˜Those two lines,â€™ the black and blue lines in FigureÂ 16. Remember A change in the price of the product itself causes movement along the demand or supply curve; all nonprice factors cause shifts in the demand or supply curves. But what impact will these non-price factors have on negotiations in the marketplace? What would happen to prices and to the equilibrium point in a market if there was a change in the number of suppliers or the number of customers? You know these non-price factors cause shifts of the demand or supply curves, but how would these shifts impact on prices, quantities and the equilibrium point? I shall answer these questions in this section by continuing my explanation of market functioning. I shall start with a change in the number of customers. For example, if you took everyone from your class to the market to buy tomatoes, this would cause a shift in the demand curve. The number of customers has increased, so demand will increase, but supply will stay the same. This can be illustrated by a rightward shift of the demand curve while the supply curve remains unchanged. You know from FigureÂ 14 that the price and quantity originally settled at an equilibrium point, $3.50 and 3.5Â kg, which is represented by PointÂ E on the graph.

Figure 17: increase in demand

When a non-price factor causes an increase in demand, the original demand curve, the thick black line in FigureÂ 17, shifts to a new position, labelled D1. This corresponds to a move along the supply curve, so a new equilibrium is established at PointÂ  E1. The new point of equilibrium entails an increase in the price of tomatoes from $3.50 to $5 and an increase in quantity from 3.5Â kg to 5Â kg. This causation chain can be summarised as 	 Incr

Different market structures

In the previous section I assumed that markets are competitive and free from external interventions. I shall now explore different market structures, different sets of market conditions under which firms operate. In this section I shall define two extreme market structures: the perfectly competitive market and the imperfectly competitive market.

7.7	

PC: Perfect Competition

Perfect competition is a useful theoretical concept but, in real life, you will never find a market with perfect competition. It is a market structure that is best understood by its assumptions. A perfectly competitive market is a market that is characterised by the following conditions: â€¢	 A large number of small firms operate as sellers in the market. â€¢	 There is free entry to the market. â€¢	 There is easy exit from the market. â€¢	 Sellers are price takers. This means they are too small in relation to the size of the market to influence the price. A seller must either accept the market price or exit from the market. Such sellers are said to â€˜meet TINAâ€™ because There Is No Alternative. â€¢	 Firms sell homogeneous products, products that are either identical or so similar that buyers are indifferent as to which one they buy. â€¢	 All actors in the market are perfectly well informed. Information about the products is free and readily available to every buyer and every seller.

No market satisfies all these assumptions; nothing in life is perfect; there is no such thing as perfect competition. The market that comes closest to being perfectly competitive is probably the market for agriculture produce. This market is used in economics as a benchmark to compare real market structures and assess how far they are from being perfectly competitive.

The Fourth Principle: negotiations

As you can see from FigureÂ 21, an individual firm in a perfectly competitive market faces a horizontal demand curve. Each firm is a price taker, it is too small to affect the price, so the demand is equal to the market price. At that price, each individual firm can sell as much of its product as it wants. This also means that demand is perfectly elastic, if a firm increased its price by even the smallest amount, it would sell none of its product. The blue line in FigureÂ 21 is a supply curve in a perfect market. Sellers will continue to supply some of their products only as long as the market price allows them to make a profit. Therefore the supply curve is depicted as starting at the market price, the price that each seller has to take.

7.8	

IC: imperfect competition

Just as a PC market structure is characterised by meeting a list of assumptions, an IC market structure is characterised by doing the opposite. There are several forms of imperfect competition, notably a monopoly, which displays the following characteristics: â€¢	 Only one firm acts as a seller in this market. â€¢	 There are barriers to entry. These may be natural, geographic, technological or legal barriers. â€¢	 The firm is a price maker, it sets the price of its own product. â€¢	 The firm is selling a unique product. â€¢	 Information about the product is not freely available. FigureÂ 22 illustrates the effect of a monopoly. It refers to marginal costs and marginal revenue, which I shall explain in detail in the next chapter.

The Fourth Principle: negotiations

In a monopoly, the firm applies the Profit Maximising Rule: it sets the quantity at PointÂ  A where the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue. It then uses its position as a price maker to set the monopoly price at PointÂ B on the demand curve directly above PointÂ A. PointÂ B (Q=3Â & P=5) represents threeÂ units being sold at $5 each. Competition in this market would have resulted in four units being sold for $4 each which is represented by PointÂ E (Q=4Â & P=4). There are several forms of imperfect competition.

Barriers to entry define several types of monopoly. For example: â€¢	 A natural monopoly occurs when the type of industry makes it financially impractical, if not impossible, for multiple companies to engage in the business. For example, it would be practically impossible for more than one firm to supply water to a city. Each of the potential suppliers would need to build a water supply infrastructure, which would be financially and spatially unsustainable. â€¢	 A geographic monopoly, or spatial monopoly, occurs when there is only one company offering a particular good or service in an area. For example, it may financially unsustainable to operate more than one general store in a country town because of the small population size. â€¢	 A technological monopoly occurs when a good or service has legal protection in the form of a patent or copyright. For example, Apple has a patent to make and sell iPhones. â€¢	 A government can also form a monopoly when, for example, a certain company is given an exclusive license to provide a specific service on the governmentâ€™s behalf.

If you have devised a new solution to a problem or invented a new product to make peopleâ€™s lives easier, I strongly encourage you to establish a business to make your dream a reality. You would then have demonstrated entrepreneurial skills, the most important factor in production. There are also other factors that will be essential to the success of your business. These factors, and their costs, will be covered is this section. When establishing any business, there are three factors of production to consider in addition to entrepreneurship. They are land, capital and labour. You will need land for an office; you will need to raise capital; you will have to employ people. You will, of course, have to pay the price for each of these resources, you will have to bear the costs. For entrepreneurship, the price is profit; for land, the price is rent; for capital, the price is interest; for labour, the price is wages.

8.3	

Total costs

For the purposes of this discussion, I shall assume that you are dealing with a short term production run. A short run production is one where the short time frame means that some of the costs cannot be varied. For this example, I shall assume that the cost of land and the cost of capital are fixed for the duration of your production run. On the other hand, you can change cost of labour fairly quickly by hiring or laying off staff. Your total costs are equal to the total fixed costs plus the total variable costs: TC = TFC + TVC Total fixed costs are the costs that cannot be changed, regardless of the number of units produced. Total fixed costs do not depend on output, they must be paid even if your output is zero. For example, you have to pay the rent and make your interest payments regardless of your production levels.

The Fifth Principle: costs

For your firm to start and then to expand its production, you need to hire labour and pay their wages, and you need to buy raw materials. The costs related to all the variable inputs, the total variable costs, are in addition to the total fixed costs. As a manager, you can control these variable costs by managing inputs, by changing the level of production. An increase in production needs more of each of the variable inputs: labour, raw materials, electricity and so on. TableÂ 6 is the schedule of short run costs for an imaginary firm.

Average costs

If you are to manage production, you must be able to estimate the total cost per unit of production. There are three relevant figures here: average fixed cost, average variable cost and average total cost.

The per-unit cost or average total cost is

As production expands, total fixed costs disperse over more units of output. They contribute less to the cost of each unit, average fixed costs are reduced and perunit costs are reduced. For example, if you are paying $100 in rent and interest, and you are producing 10 units of your product, the fixed costs are $100/10Â =Â $10Â perÂ unit. If you increase production to 20 units, fixed costs are spread over 20 units and become $100/20Â =Â $5Â perÂ unit.

Marginal costs

One of the most important concepts in microeconomics is the concept of marginal cost. In economics, marginal means extra or additional, so a marginal cost is an additional cost. The marginal cost of production is

In other words, the marginal cost of production is the additional cost caused by each additional unit of production. You need to calculate the marginal cost if you want to find the cost of increasing your output.

This graph makes several points clear. The curve for marginal cost, MC, first decreases until it reaches its minimum point, then it increases, making a shape that is something like the Nike trade mark. The curves for average variable cost, AVC, and average total cost, ATC, also decrease then increase, but they are smoother than the MC curve so they are more U-shaped. The interesting observation to make here is that the MC curve intersects both the AVC and ATC curves at their minimum points. In addition, where the marginal cost is less than the average variable cost, the average variable cost is decreasing; where the marginal cost is above the average variable cost, the average variable cost is increasing. This is the Marginal-Average Rule. MC < AVC â‡’ AVC

Aside I once called this exercise â€˜Sudokuâ€™ to my students. The following day one student, who had not attended that class, heard that we were doing Sudoku and came to my office. He said, â€˜Sir, I couldnâ€™t find any Sudoku in the textbook to practice for the assignment so I did a few Sudoku from the newspaper. Is that OK?â€™ Further discussion The Profit Maximising Rule The reason for learning about costs is to find ways to minimise them and to maximise profits. The Profit Maximising Rule is used to find the specific level of production that will maximise profit or minimise costs. There are two ways to find out about the profit-maximising quantity of output. The first is to find the maximum difference between the total costs and the total revenue. Profit = TC â€“ TR and TR is found by multiplying the unit price and the number of units: TR = P Ã— Q Another way of finding the profit-maximising level of production is to apply marginal analysis: find the quantity of output at which the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue. This is the Profit Maximising Rule. It states: Profit is at the maximum when the marginal cost of production is equal to the marginal revenue. MC = MR â‡’ max profit The Profit Maximising Rule applies to firms in every market structure. Regardless of the market structure, a firm will set its quantity of output so that the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue in order to maximise its profits. Reminder You have seen the Profit Maximising Rule before, in The Fourth Principle. In FigureÂ 22 you saw that a firm with a monopoly would set the quantity at the level where MC=MR, and then increases the price to meet the demand curve. A firm in a perfectly competitive market will also set the quantity of output where MC=MR. This case was illustrated in FigureÂ 21. When there is perfect competition, the MC curve coincides with the part of the supply curve above the demand curve, and the MR curve coincides with the demand curve. Remember When you calculate a marginal value, you divide a change in total value by a change in quantity, and express the result as a fraction or a ratio. This applies to marginal cost, marginal revenue, marginal utility, marginal return or any other marginal value. For example, if you know the total revenue, you can calculate the marginal revenue by dividing the change in total revenue by the change in quantity 	 	 Marginal revenue is

From the TableÂ 8, you can see that the marginal cost is approximatley equal to the marginal revenue when the quantity is 18 units.

9	 Instead of a conclusion
This book is the result of many decades of international teaching experience in which I have challenged the accepted convention that economics cannot be explained in simple, laymanâ€™s language. In this book I have presented, in simple terms, the core of the most difficult and the most important principles of microeconomics. I have taught economics for more than two decades all over the world. In each country, with its distinct culture, customs and languages, my teaching philosophy has been the same: use simplicity, honesty, humour and show respect for differences in the learning styles of students. This book offers a straightforward answer to the question â€˜why have economics subjects attracted such negative responses from students?â€™ The principles of economic theory have to be explained in terms of everyday activities. Everyday activities are, after all, what economics is all about! Yes, every day we use complicated economic laws without even noticing. Having studied this book, you are well set for further exploration of the subject and prepared to understand more substantial economics texts. This book should be the hook to get you to appreciate something that is useful in everyday life and, at the same time, is very simple: economics. Once hooked, you will be a more informed citizen, you will understand what all those serious-looking experts and politicians are talking about. If, after reading this book, you realise how simple economics can be, and you decide to keep exploring the subject or even to become an economist, then the mission of the book has been accomplished.

The Third Principle
1.	 Elasticity of demand is a measure of sensitivity of the quantity demanded to changes in the price. Similar statements apply to elasticity of supply and elasticity of income. 2.	 Price elasticity of demand is a ratio. If the numerator is larger than the denominator, the ratio is greater than one, which means that the relationship is positive. 3.	 Price elasticity of demand is a ratio. Unit elasticity arises when the numerator equals the denominator, the ratio is then equal to one. 4.	 Because demand shows the negative relationship between price and quantity 5.	 If the price elasticity of demand is 3, it means that for each 1% increase in price there is a 3% decrease in the quantity demanded. 6.	 If the price elasticity of supply is 3, it means that for each 1% increase in price there is a 3% increase in the quantity supplied. 7.	 If the income elasticity is 3, it means that for each 1% increase in income there is a 3% increase in the quantity demanded. 8.	 We can conclude that these two products are substitutes. 9.	 We can conclude that these two products are complements. 10.	 The difference between price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply is a + or â€“ sign on the ratio. Since demand has a negative relationship between quantity and price, price elasticity of demand has a negative sign (which is later dropped). In contrast, supply has a positive relationship between price and quantity; price elasticity of supply is always positive.

Simplified Principles of Microeconomics

Glossary

Economics â€“ scientific discipline about how scarce resources are managed in the most efficient way. It is about the everyday activities of an typical rational person Elasticity â€“ response, reaction of quantity demanded to a price change Equilibrium â€“ balance, equality Factors of production â€“ necessary production inputsâ€¨ Fixed costs â€“ costs that do not change with the level of production Geographic monopoly, or spatial monopoly â€“ a firm that is the only supplier in a particular geographical area Inverse (negative, opposite, indirect) relationship â€“ a situation in which two variables are moving in opposite directions Law of Demand â€“ a rule which postulate that when the price is increasing the quantity demand is decreasing Long run â€“ a time frame in which all factors of production are variable Marginal â€“ extra, additional Marginal analysis â€“ The maximum profit can be calculated for each unit produced by deducting total cost from the total revenue. Another way of finding the profit-maximising level of production is to apply marginal analysis, that is, to find the quantity of output at which the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue. Marginal-Average Rule â€“ a rule that postulate where the marginal cost is less than the average variable cost, the average variable cost is decreasing; where the marginal cost is above the average variable cost, the average variable cost is increasing. Market â€“ place of trade negotiation between market forces Market clearing price â€“ a price at which demand and supply are equal Market clearing quantity â€¨â€“ a quantity at which demand and supply are equal

1.	 I am intentionally using different words for the same thing: graph, figure or diagram. This is so you will not be so confused later when you see the same thing called differently by different authors. 2.	 By the way, I could choose the combination of products represented by PointÂ J (A=3Â &Â B=3) but it would not an optimal choice for me. Why would I chose that combination when I could have more products by choosing the combination at PointÂ F or PointÂ G? 3.	 As earlier, this firm could produce combinations of three ProductÂ A and three ProductÂ B (PointÂ J), but it would not be an efficient use of the available resources. The most efficient use of resources is when the production is illustrated by one of the combinations represented on the black line. 4.	 I have restricting my discussion to the example of bottled water for the sake of simplicity. In reality, the arguments may not apply in this case but they will apply to many other products and services. 5.	 I have restricting my discussion to the example of bottled water for the sake of simplicity. In reality, the arguments may not apply in this case but they will apply to many other products and services. 6.	 A percentage is calculated from a ratio of two values with the same unit of measure. Because the units are the same, they cancel out and give you a unit-less measure. 7.	 In everyday speech, you may refer to â€˜goods and servicesâ€™. In their technical writing, economists will also refer to â€˜a goodâ€™ or â€˜a serviceâ€™ when there is only one. 8.	 I have avoided labelling any point as D because I shall be using D to denote the quantity demanded.
