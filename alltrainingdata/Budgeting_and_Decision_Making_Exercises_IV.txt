Problem 1

Problem 1
Canadian Autoparts manufactures and sells alternators. Canadian has been producing and selling approximately 1,500,000 units per year. Each units sells for $350, and there are no variable selling, general, or administrative costs. The company has been approached by a foreign supplier who wishes to provide an alternator component for $45 per unit. Total annual manufacturing costs, including the alternator component, is as follows: Direct materials	 Direct labor	 Variable factory overhead	 Fixed factory overhead	 $120,000,000 192,000,000 38,400,000 84,000,000

If Canadian Autoparts outsources the alternator component, it is expected that direct materials will be reduced by 15%, direct labor by 20%, and variable factory overhead by 25%. There will be no reduction in fixed factory overhead. a)	 Should Canadian Autoparts outsource the alternator component? b)	 If outsourcing the alternator component will free up capacity, and enable Canadian Autoparts to increase production and sales to 1,750,000 units per year, would it make sense to outsource?

It appears that it will cost more to outsource. Based on this quantitative analysis the company would not outsource the compressors.

Problem 1

Solution 1
a)	
Internal Direct materials Direct labor Variable factory overhead Fixed factory overhead Outsourced compressors (1,500,000 X $45) Total cost of each option $	 $	120,000,000 192,000,000 38,400,000 84,000,000 ‚Äì 434,400,000 Outsource $	102,000,000 153,600,000 28,800,000 84,000,000 67,500,000 $	435,900,000

It appears that it will cost more to outsource. Based on this quantitative analysis the company would not outsource the compressors.

b)	
Outsource @ 1,750,000 units Direct materials (1,750,000/1,500,000 X $102,000,000) Direct labor (1,750,000/1,500,000 X $153,600,000) Variable factory overhead (1,750,000/1,500,000 X $28,800,000) Fixed factory overhead Outsourced compressors (1,750,000 X $45) Total cost if 1,750,000 units are built $	119,000,000 179,200,000 33,600,000 84,000,000 78,750,000 $	494,550,000

Although costs increase by $60,150,000 ($494,550,000 ‚Äì $434,400,000), revenues would increase far more (250,000 additional units X $350 each = $87,500,000). It seems that the company will be better off by outsourcing. The company would also want to consider nonquantitative factors such as quality of product and reliability of the supply chain.

Problem 2

Problem 2
Industrial Bearings manufactures high quality ball bearings. The cost of producing a box of 100 bearings is as follows: Direct materials	 Direct labor	 Variable factory overhead	 Fixed factory overhead	 Variable selling, general, and administrative costs	 Fixed selling, general, and administrative costs	 $2.50 3.25 8.75 12.00 8.75 2.00

The fixed factory overhead and fixed SG&A cost is allocated based on an assumption that the business will produce 200,000 boxes of paintballs per year. The company has capacity to produce 300,000 boxes without impacting either category of fixed cost. a)	 The market for bearings has become very competitive and management has requested to know the break-even price that can be charged for a box of bearings, assuming production and sale of 200,000 boxes. b)	 Management has received a special order request for 100,000 boxes of ‚Äúprivate label‚Äù bearings. The order specifies a per box price of $35. How will profitability be impacted if the order is accepted?

Problem 2

Solution 2
a)	
Direct materials Direct labor Variable factory overhead Fixed factory overhead Variable selling, general, and administrative costs Fixed selling, general, and administrative costs Total per unit cost @ 200,000 boxes $	2.50 3.25 8.75 12.00 8.75 2.00 $	37.25

The company needs to price the paintballs at $37.25 per box to cover all costs.

b)	 Accepting the special order will improve profitability. The variable costs are $56.25 ($2.50¬†+ $3.25 + $8.75 + $8.75), and the order price of $35.00 per box has a per unit contribution margin of $11.75 ($35.00 ‚Äì $23.25). Fixed costs will not change, thus overall profitability will significantly improve.

Problem 3

Problem 3
Duty Free Shopping produces a catalog that is placed in airline seatbacks during international flights. Passengers typically skim the catalog during flights and can buy selected merchandise from flight attendants, duty and tax free, while over international waters. Below is a report for a recent period:
Total Sales Variable expenses Contribution margin Fixed expenses Income (loss) $	4,940,000 3,378,000 $	1,562,000 1,500,000 $	62,000 Electronics $	1,330,000 900,000 $	430,000 500,000 $	(70,000) Jewelry $	2,660,000 2,128,000 $	532,000 500,000 $	32,000 Beverages $	950,000 350,000 $	600,000 500,000 $	100,000

The fixed expense is the amount paid for printing the catalog and paying the airline to include the item in seatbacks. Management is evaluating discontinuing the sale of electronics products. Fixed costs will not change, however, jewelry sales are expected to increase by 15%. Determine if overall income will be improved if the sale of electronics products is ceased.

Problem 3

Solution 3
Below is an analysis reflecting the elimination of electronics. Jewelry sales and variable expenses of jewelry are each increased by 15%. The total fixed costs of $1,500,000 are distributed evenly to the two product lines.
Total Sales Variable expenses Contribution margin Fixed expenses Income (loss) $	4,009,000 2,797,200 $	1,211,800 1,500,000 $	(288,200) Electronics $	$	$	Jewelry $	3,059,000 2,447,200 $	611,800 750,000 $	(138,200) Beverages $	950,000 350,000 $	600,000 750,000 $	(150,000)

Note that eliminating electronics causes a sharp drop in profits. Even though Electronics appeared to result in a loss, its contribution margin was positive. The positive contribution margin helped to absorb fixed costs that cannot be avoided.

Problem 4

Problem 4
Consider an investment scenario involving a level stream of three annual payments of $3,000 each (i.e., an annuity). The first payment occurs at the beginning of the first year, and the subsequent payments occur at the beginning of each of the next two years. The invested balance will accrue interest at 10% per year, compounded annually. a)	 Calculate the accumulated balance at the end of the third year. Use the approach illustrated in the text to demonstrate the intrinsic calculations, and then verify your answer by reference to the appropriate future value table. b)	 Show how your answer to part (a) would differ if you change the assumption to ‚Äúend of year‚Äù payments. c)	 Using the future value tables, calculate how your answer to part (a) would differ if you change the assumption to six semiannual (beginning of period) payments, with the 10% annual rate now being assumed to compound semiannually.
