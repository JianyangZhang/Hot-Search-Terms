Deep Water Sport Fishing Corporation owns many sport fishing boats. The company has usually contracted with a trucking company to haul the boats to the boat dealership for repairs. With the aging of the boats, the company is incurring substantial hauling costs because of the increasing frequency of repairs. The company is considering trading a boat for a trailer, thereby enabling it to haul boats without having to hire a trucking company. This exchange transaction would significantly improve the company‚Äôs cash flow and does have ‚Äúcommercial substance. The trailer that will be acquired in the exchange has a fair value of $15,000. Deep Water owns two boats that are currently valued at $85,000. One of these two boats will be exchanged (and no boot will be involved). Art Fish, the owner of the Deep Water, is trying to decide which boat to give up, and is interested in learning about the financial statement impact of the exchange. Prepare alternative journal entries, assuming an exchange of Boat A versus Boat B. Facts about each boat follow: Boat A	 Cost, $105,000; accumulated depreciation $75,000 Boat B	 Cost, $60,000; accumulated depreciation $35,000

Problem 4
Liquid Gold Oil acquired an existing oil well and all related equipment used in the production of oil. Liquid Gold paid $5,000,000, of which 30% was attributable to pumps, pipelines, and tanks. The oil well is expected to produce oil as follows: Year 1	 Year 2	 Year 3	 Year 4	 Year 5	 200 barrels per day 160 barrels per day 120 barrels per day 100 barrels per day 50 barrels per day

At the end of the 5th year, Liquid Gold anticipates selling the oil well and equipment for $2,000,000. Of this amount, $500,000 is expected to be attributable to the equipment. Assuming the above estimates serve as the basis for depletion, calculate depletion cost for the 3rd year. Prepare an approriate journal entry for depletion. In preparing the entry, assume that all oil is sold at the time of its production (i.e., none of the oil remains in inventory).

Problem 4

Solution
The production rate during the 3rd year is 20% of the expected total production (based on a run rate of ‚Äú120/(200 + 160 + 120 + 100 + 20)‚Äù). Therefore, depletion would be 20% of the depletable base. The depletion is calculated as follows:
Total cost Portion represented by natural resource Total natural resource cost Less: Residual value ($2,000,000 ‚Äì $500,000) Depletable base Portion attributable to Year 3 Year 3 depletion X X $	5,000,000 70% $	3,500,000 1,500,000 $	2,000,000 20% $	400,000

Note that the equipment cost would be depreciated separately.

Problem 6
Johansen Corporation‚Äôs accounting staff was unsure of how to account for certain expenditures relating to its property, plant, and equipment. As a result, the company has delayed recording entries related to the following transactions. In addition, until these items are resolved, the determination of depreciation expense for the year has been delayed. Item A	 The company‚Äôs delivery truck, originally costing $65,000 and having a 5-year life with no salvage value, was substantially overhauled at a cost of $15,000. This expenditure occurred at the beginning of the year, when the truck was three years old. This action restored the truck to ‚Äúlike-new‚Äù condition, and extended the useful life by an additional three years. Item B	 At mid-year, the company added a new $80,000 dust handling unit to the heating and ventilation system in its inventory warehouse. This new feature is supposed to reduce dust from the air and provide for a cleaner environment in which to store inventory. The new dust unit has a 15-year physical life, but it is anticipated that it will be scraped 9 and one-half years after its installation, when the primary heating system is replaced. As of the beginning of the year, the heating and ventilation system had a cost of $350,000 and accumulated depreciation of $150,000. Item C	 The company entered into a 5-year contract with Master Maintenance Services Company. The agreement provides for Johansen to make monthly payments of $2,500 for all routine cleaning and maintenance activities on shop equipment. Two months of services had been provided and paid as of the end of the year. As of the beginning of the year, shop equipment had a remaining net book value of $200,000, and a remaining life of four years. Item D	 Johansen entered into a joint agreement with several other companies to mutually acquire an easement on an adjoining tract of land. The easement was needed to provide right-of-way for a future rail transport line extension that will benefit all of the participating companies. Johansen paid $30,000 for its share of the access easement. The easement is perpetual in nature. Prepare journal entries for each of the four described expenditures. Then, calculate depreciation, as appropriate, for the expenditure and/or related assets. Assume straight-line depreciation in each case.
