About the Author
After leaving school in Sheffield, UK, Steve worked in the print industry for 10 years before being made redundant. He decided to return to education and completed courses in many subjects including Information Technology, Business and Finance, Sound Engineering and Music Production, Science and a BSc. in Biomedical Science. After graduating, Steve had several jobs in various scientific fields including immunology and developmental genetics, during which time he developed a keen interest in digital imaging which progressed into an interest in creative Photography. After his current contract had expired, he undertook a course in Photoshop Artistry at the University of Sheffield. He soon realised that he had already amassed a great deal of knowledge in this field and knew more about image editing and processing than the lecturer. The lecturer asked if Steve would take over in teaching the course as he was leaving for another position. He contacted the University and was given a position as an associate lecturer teaching Photoshop Artistry, Computer Graphics and Advanced Digital Imaging. Steve taught at the University of Sheffield for three years and then decided to pursue a career in providing bespoke training and consultancy in Photoshop and Digital Photography. He has continued in this role for the past seven years. Steve remains an avid consumer of knowledge and education and has completed over thirty online courses and has become an Adobe Certified Expert in Photoshop and a respected Photographer in his own right.

Introduction

Introduction
This is the second book in this series, written to help develop essential skills in using Adobe Photoshop. This book is for people who have an understanding of Photoshop’s basic functions and would like to build on that knowledge. We will build on the basic skills covered in the previous book and we will also be taking a look at several new tools, adjustments, editing methodology and workflow options. We will also cover two ancillary programs that ship as part of the Photoshop package – Adobe Bridge and Adobe Camera Raw. Photoshop is a large and complex program, and as such, requires practice and patience to develop the skills required to be an effective user. I encourage you to use these three books as a starting point and go on to develop your own workflows and techniques.

1	 Adobe Bridge and Mini Bridge
Before we get to Photoshop, it is important to take a minute to explore the image editing workflow, fig1.1. When you install Photoshop, a second program called Adobe Bridge is also installed automatically, along with an editing plugin called Adobe Camera Raw (ACR). Adobe Bridge acts as a digital light-table and allows you to organise, categorize, filter and edit all of the media on your computer. From Adobe Bridge it is possible to choose to open a document with any of the Adobe suite of programs that support that file type. If the image is a raw, jpg or tiff (flattened) file, it can also be opened in Adobe Camera Raw.

Fig. 1.1 recommended image editing workflow

In many cases all of the editing for a particular image can be performed in the Camera Raw plugin (see the section on Camera Raw). If further editing is needed, or you wish to print an image, you may then choose to open the image in Photoshop. Adobe Bridge can be opened from the same program folder as Photoshop. If you already have Photoshop open, you can access Bridge or Mini Bridge by clicking on one of the following icons located in the top left corner.

Bridge Panels and Workspaces
As you can see in fig 1.2, the Adobe Bridge contains many tabbed panels. These panels may be opened or closed from the Window menu. As with Photoshop, you can drag the panel tabs into new locations or groupings and save the new layout as a custom workspace. To save a Workspace, go to the Window menu > Workspace and choose the New Workspace option, fig 1.3.

Fig 1.3 save your Workspace in the Window menu

Adobe Bridge comes with many preset Workspaces, each one designed with a particular operation in mind, as you can see from their names, fig 1.4.

Fig 1.4 you can switch between several preset Workspaces by clicking on its name in the options panel.

Labelling and Ranking Images
If you have a folder containing a large number of images, you can go through them and quickly assign a label or star rating (fig 1.6) to the image so that you can use the filtering options to just select certain images. To assign a star rating, click on the dots beneath the image or right click on the image in the Preview panel. You can also assign a star rating by using the keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl (Mac/PC) + 1-5. To assign a coloured label you may either right click on the image in the Preview or Content panels (in the Labels submenu) and select the appropriate label, or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl (Mac/PC) + 6-9. Both ratings and labels may also be assigned from the Label menu.

Fig 1.6 this image has been assigned 5 stars and red label.

Keywords and Filtering
Keywords are added to a document (or multiple documents) in the Keyword panel. You can add new keywords to the list by clicking on the + icon at the bottom of the Keyword panel, fig 1.7. To apply a keyword to a document, select a document or documents and then simply click in the box next to the keyword in the Keyword panel to associate that word with your document, fig 1.7. Keywords are embedded in the documents metadata and show up as tags in many utilities and programs. For example, if you keyword and image and then post it to Flickr, the keywords will appear as tags and are a searchable feature of that image.

Fig 1.7 the Keyword panel

I have mentioned previously that you can use the Filter panel to find specific document based on labels. You can also filter your documents based on Keywords. If you select a group of documents or folders, any keywords assigned to those documents will appear in the Keywords section of the Filter panel, fig 1.8. If you click on a keyword in the Filter panel only the documents that have that keyword will appear in the contents window, all of the other documents will be hidden. To remove the filter, click on the keyword once again in the Filter panel.

The Collections Panel
Once you have filtered your documents and found the one you want, you may wish to save them as a Collection. A Collection is created in the Collections panel by clicking on the and simply drag the documents into it. At the bottom of the Collections panel there is also an icon that allows you to create a Smart Collection. If you click on the Smart Collection icon a dialogue box will appear that allows you to set certain criteria for documents that are to be included in the Smart Collection, fig 1.9. icon at the bottom of the panel. If you have document selected, you will be asked if you wish to include them in the Collection. You can also create an Empty Collection folder

In fig 1.9 you can see that the Criteria for this smart Collection is to included documents that have “Charlotte” in the filename. Once a Smart Collection is set up, any subsequent documents that are added to the Source folder will be automatically added to the Smart Collection. This is an extremely useful function, because you can use Smart Collections for keeping all documents from a certain client together, or documents created with in a specific time period, or any other purpose that you require.

Mini Bridge
The Mini Bridge is a tabbed panel in Photoshop CS5 and later, fig 1.10. It is a quick file browsing tool that offers some basic features of the full version of Bridge. To browse files in Mini Bridge requires the full version of Bridge to be running in the background. If you do not have Bridge already running the Mini Bridge will launch the program automatically if you choose to “Browse Files”.

Camera Raw

2	 Camera Raw
It may often be the case that you only need to make basic adjustments to your images. If so, you can perform nondestructive edits to your images in Camera Raw without even opening Photoshop. Camera Raw was designed to make initial adjustments to Raw images before taking them into Photoshop, but it has grown into a fairly comprehensive editing solution in its own right. If you are not a Photographer you may not have come across Raw images before. In addition to capturing JPG and TIFF images, many high end compacts and all dSLR’s are able to save images in the Raw format. This means that the image is saved at the maximum bit depth and is not processed. The resulting file contains the maximum amount of information the camera is able to capture. Note: Every camera manufacturer has its own proprietary Raw format. Adobe Camera Raw can read Raw data hundreds of different cameras. However, if you by a brand new camera its Raw format may not be supported by the program until the next update. Check the Adobe website for the latest version of Camera Raw. If there is no update available and you want to use Camera Raw you can download the Adobe DNG Converter from the Adobe website. The utility will convert Raw files into Adobes own format, the Digital Negative (DNG). In the last few versions of Photoshop it has also been possible to open JPG and TIFF formats in Camera Raw. However, in versions prior to CS5 you need to set the behaviours for JPG and TIFF files in the General Preferences if you want them to automatically open in Camera Raw. In Bridge CS5 the Camera Raw preferences are available from the Edit menu, fig 2.1.

Camera Raw

Whenever you edit a file in Camera Raw your original image remains unchanged. Instead of saving an altered version of the image, Camera Raw saves a small “sidecar” file which will appear in the same folder as the image and have a XMP file extension. It is important that the XMP file remains with the image, because it records all of the edits that you have made in Camera Raw. If you use the Adobe DNG format, it has the benefit of being able to store the Camera Raw edits in the original file and so a sidecar file will not be created. You can also choose to have the edit data saved to the Camera Raw Database in the Camera Raw Preferences, fig 2.1. If you go down this route, please note that if you transfer the image to another machine, the edit information will not be transferred unless it is in the DNG format.

The Camera Raw Interface

Fig 2.2 the Adobe Camera Raw interface version 6.6

Across the top left of the interface are a series of tools, for editing your image. From left to right, they are: 1.	 The Zoom Tool – Click and drag to magnify part the image. Double click on the icon to go to a 100% view. 2.	 The Hand Tool – Navigate when zoomed into an image by using the hand tool to move the image around. Double click on the hand tool to fit the image to the work area. 3.	 The White Balance Tool – Click on a neutral colour in the image to set the white balance and remove any colour cast.

4.	 The Colour Sampler Tool – Use this tool to see the RGB values of specific pixel values. The values are given in the RGB section located below the Histogram in the top right. 5.	 The Targeted Adjustment Tool – Select a parameter from the drop down list (fig 2.3) and click and drag in the image to change the values. Dragging to the right increases the value and dragging to the left decreases the value. You can also choose to drag up and down.Fig 2.3 the Targeted Adjustment Tool drop down menu options.


6.	 The Crop Tool – Crop your image non-destructively with this tool. Use the drop down menu (fig 2.4) to select a specific aspect ratio or clear a previous crop.

7.	 The Straighten Tool – Click and drag along an edge in your image that should be vertical or horizontal. When you select another tool the image is automatically straightened and cropped. 8.	 The Spot Removal Tool – Use this tool to remove sensor dust spot from your image. Click and drag over the dust spot and Camera Raw will automatically select a clear area to fill your selection. You can adjust these areas by clicking inside one of the circles and dragging. 9.	 The Redeye Removal Tool – Click and drag over the eye area and the redeye will automatically be fixed. Use the panel on the right to adjust the pupil size and darken values if necessary. 10.	The Adjustment Brush – Apply basic adjustments to localized areas of the image by painting them onto the image using this tool. The adjustments that can be applied with this tool will appear in the panel on the right once the tool has been selected, fig 2.5. The Auto Mask checked box at the bottom of the panel (fig 2.5), restricts the area in which you can paint to a similar range of pixel values. This can be very useful if you need to paint up to an edge but not go over it.

11.	The Gradient Filter – This tool works in a similar fashion to the Adjustment Brush, but instead of painting, you click and drag to create a gradient which applies the adjustment values you have chosen. At the start of the gradient the adjustment is applied at 100%, gradually reducing to 0% at the end point of the gradient. 12.	The Open Preferences Dialogue – Opens the same Dialogue box that is available from the Bridge menu, fig 2.1. 13.	Rotate Anti-Clockwise – Rotates the image 90 degrees anti-clockwise 14.	Rotate Clockwise – Rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise

Basic Adjustments
On the right of the Camera Raw interface are a series of 10 tabbed panels. We are going to take a look at the first of these panels, the Basic panel. It is often the case, that 80-100% of the image adjustments that you need to make can be achieved using only this panel, fig 2.6.


Figure 2.6 the Basic Adjustment tabbed panel.

It is recommended that you edit your image in the Basic panel by starting at the top and working your way down to the bottom. White Balance – This consists of a drop down menu and two sliders. The drop down menu contains a number of white balance presets similar to the one found in most cameras, fig 2.7 (left). However, this list is only available when working with Raw file formats.

You can adjust the White Balance manually using the Temperature and Tint sliders, regardless of which image format you are using. •	 Exposure – Lightens or darkens the entire image in standard f-stop increments. •	 Recovery – Moving this slider to the right will darken the very brightest values in your image to recover detail in the highlights. •	 Fill Light - Moving this slider to the right will lighten the darkest areas of the image in an attempt to recover detail in the shadows. •	 Blacks – Set the black point in the image. Moving the slider to the right will send more pixel values to pure black. •	 Brightness – Makes the light areas lighter whilst leaving the darkest areas alone. •	 Contrast – Increase the contrast of the image by making the dark areas darker and the light areas lighter.

•	 Clarity – Moving this slider to the right makes the image look sharper and clearer by adding micro contrast adjustment to edges. Moving the slider to the left will soften the image which can be nice when used on portraits. •	 Vibrance – Alters the saturation of colours in the image, but has less effect on colours that are already saturated or contain flesh tones. •	 Saturation – Affects the saturation all of the colours in the image equally.

Camera Raw Workflow Options
An often overlooked setting in Camera Raw is the Workflow Options. These settings are accessed by clicking on the blue hyperlink (fig 2.8) at the bottom of the Camera Raw work area. In the Workflow options dialogue box we have the option to: •	 Set the colour space for the image •	 The Depth option allows you to set the number of bits per RGB channel. •	 Set the image size. You can increase or decrease the image size in set increments. •	 Set the image resolution. •	 Add a preset amount of sharpening. You can choose to add sharpening for the screen or matte/glossy prints. •	 Select to always open the image in Photoshop as a Smart Object (see the section on Smart Objects).



Saving Images from within Camera Raw
In the bottom left corner of the Camera Raw work area there is an option to “Save” your image. This means that you can edit an image in Camera Raw and save out a finished version as a JPG, TIFF, DNG or PSD without ever opening Photoshop. The Workflow Options can be very helpful at this point because you can change the settings according to suit the purpose of the file. For example, you may wish to create a small, low resolution file to attach to an Email. However, it is important that you change the Workflow Options back to their original settings, otherwise all of your subsequent documents will be formatted as small, low resolution images.

Transformations

3	Transformations
One of Photoshop most powerful features is the ability to resize, distort and warp an object within an image. For example, in fig 3.1 we have a landscape image that features the moon. If we make a selection of the moon using any of the selection tools, it can then be copied to a new layer by going to the Layer menu and choosing New > Layer via Copy. A copy of the selected area will then appear in a new layer in the Layers panel, fig 3.2.

In fig 3.4 the Scale Transformation has been used to increase the size of the Moon. To use the Scale Transformation to click on the option in the Edit menu (fig 3.3) and with the Shift key held down you simply drag one of the corner points in the box that surrounds the Moon. Holding down the Shift key results in the Transformation occurring, whilst maintaining the original proportions of the object. If you don’t use the Shift key whilst dragging a corner point the object may become deformed because the objects ratios will not be maintained. To reposition the object after a transformation, click inside the bounding box and drag the object. In all cases, once you have completed a transformation you MUST click on the tick icon in the Options panel to accept the changes to the image. You can also cancel a Transformation by clicking on the cross icon in the Options panel. When you are making a transformation you may notice that the object that you are transforming appears blurry or pixelated. This is because Photoshop is only showing you a preview. Once you click on the tick to accept the changes, Photoshop will render the object at the full resolution of the document.

Warp
Most of the Transformations are self-explanatory in their function. However, the Warp Transformation works in a slightly different manor. When you choose the Warp Transformation a grid appears inside the objects bounding box, fig 3.5.

Warping Text
Warping Type layers can be fun and creative. However, you can’t freeform Warp text as seen in in fig 3.6 without knowing a couple of things first. If you select the Warp command and try to Warp a standard Type layer you will be made to choose one of a number of preset warp shapes, fig 3.7, located in the Options panel. You can then edit the Warp, within the confines of the shape, by clicking and dragging inside the bounding box. To freeform Warp the text you must do one of two things. Either Rasterize the Type layer by going to the Layer menu or choosing Rasterize > Type, fig 3.8, or choose Smart Objects > Convert to Smart Object to create a Smart Object from the Type layer, fig 3.9.

The Smart Object route is the most flexible as the text may still be edited (see the chapter on Smart Object for more details). Once a Type layer is Rasterized the Type then becomes pixels and cannot be edited as Type.

Free Transform
Most experienced Photoshop users prefer to use the Free Transform option for all their transformations. The Free Transform bounding box can be used to perform most of the Transformations in two different ways. Firstly, you can Right + Click inside the bounding box to get access to the individual Transformation options. Secondly, you can use modifier keys to change how the bounding box reacts to you manipulation.

Transformations

Content Aware Scale
Transformations can be very useful. However, if you need to transform an image in such a way that the aspect ratio will be changed, the standard transformation functions will distort the image in an unpleasing fashion, fig 3.10.


Fig 3.10 the original image on the left and the transformed image on the right



Content Aware Scale allows us to scale an image disproportionally by protecting key areas, which in this case would be the cricketers. The Content aware function can be found in the Edit menu. Areas can be protected during Content Aware Scaling in two different ways. 1.	 The first method protects images that contain people. To enable this feature, click on the icon in the

Options panel. Photoshop will look for flesh tones and will attempt to protect these areas during the transformation. In the image of the cricketers, there are insufficient flash tones visible for this method to work effectively. In this case we would need to use method two. 2.	 Use the Lasso tool to make a rough selection around the subjects that you wish to remain undistorted, fig 3.11.

Then go to the Select menu and choose Save Selection. This will create a new Alpha channel which you can name if you wish. Once the selection is saved, go to the Select menu once again and choose Deselect. Choose Content Aware Scale from the Edit menu and in the Protect function located in the Options panel, choose the Alpha channel that you created from the drop down menu, fig 3.12.

Fig 3.12 select the new Alpha channel from the Protect function in the Options panel.

Drag the bounding box in the direction that you wish the transformation to occur and then click on the Tick in the Options panel to accept the change.

Fig 3.13 the Content Aware Scale is completed with any distortion to the subjects

In fig 3.13 we can see the final image transformation and the appearance of the subject’s has been preserved. This technique is extremely useful when you need to make an image fit a specific graphic design or web design layout.

Smart Objects

4	 Smart Objects
Smart Objects allow editing of a document without altering the original file in any way. You can think of them as a protective container and nothing can damage your file once it’s been placed inside of the Smart Object. Smart Objects are incredibly flexible as they allow Filters to be applied non-destructively and the filter can be re-opened at any time and the settings changed. This is great if you are a designer and a client want you to make certain changes – you can simply re-open the filter that’s attached to the Smart Object and apply the required alterations. If you have a complex design, you can place groups of layers inside a Smart Object and process the independently. It is also possible to place several Smart Objects inside another Smart Object (this is called nested Smart Objects) in order to perform tasks that would be impossible (or very difficult) to do in any other way. For example, applying multiple stroke Layer Styles (see the section on Layer Styles,) to Type layers. To convert a layer to a Smart Object, go to the Layer menu and choose Smart Objects > Convert to Smart Object. Alternatively, you can also convert a layer to a Smart Object from the flyout menu in the top right-hand corner of the Layers panel, fig 4.1.

In fig 4.2 a Type layer has had two Outer Glow Layer Styles applied to it. Without using Smart Objects it would be much trickier to achieve this exact effect and would involve multiple layer and transformations. In this case all that was required was to add a blue Outer Glow Layer Style. Convert the layer to a Smart Object and then apply a red Outer Glow to the new Smart Object.

Smart Filters
If you apply a Filter from the Filter menu to a Smart Object, it will appear in the Layers panel as a Smart Filter. The layer will take on the appearance of the applied Filter but the original file contained with the Smart Object will remain unchanged. In fig 4.3, the Stained Glass filter has been applied to the Type layer Smart Object from the previous example.

A very useful feature of Smart Filters is the ability to change the Blending Options of the Filter. By clicking on the icon on the Smart Filter Layer in the Layers panel, you can alter the way in which the Filter interacts and blends with the Smart Object. In fig 4.4, the blend mode for the Stained Glass filter has been changed from Normal to Linear Burn to increase the contrast and colour strength of the filter. If the effect of changing the blending mode is too strong, it can be reduced by changing the opacity setting in the Filters Blending Options.

Editing the Contents of a Smart Object
To edit the content of a Smart Object, double click on its thumbnail image in the Layers panel. The contents will open as a new document. Change the contents of the new document and then SAVE and close it. The Smart Object in your original document we automatically be updated to reflect the changes that you have made, fig 4.5. All Layer Styles and Smart Filters will remain intact.

Fig 4.5 the contents of the Smart Object have been edited and then saved. An updated version of the Smart Object is automatically displayed.

Transformations
Every time that you make a transformation (see previous Chapter), the object is re-drawn, and so reduces in quality. If you have designed a logo that you wish to use on several sized documents such as a poster, letterheads and business cards, you will find yourself using the transformation functions to scale the logo to fit the different documents. To avoid degrading the logo as you make the transformations, place the Layers that make up the logo inside a Smart Object. When Smart Objects are transformed the original artwork remains unchanged and safe. The Smart Object merely uses its contents as a reference to produce the scaled version.

Layer Styles

5	 Layer Styles
Layer Styles are graphic effects that may be applied to an object that’s placed on its own layer, fig 5.1. The effects are applied non-destructively and the can be changed or removed at any time.

Global Light
Many of the settings in the Layer Styles dialogue box have a setting called Global Light. Global Light ensures that there is continuity between the various effects with regards to the direction of light. If the design contains an image with an existing light source, your Global Light setting should be altered to match the existing light. When you are using Layer Styles that use Contour settings, in effects such as Bevel and Emboss and Satin, the lighting position can play a massive role in the appearance of the effect, fig 5.5 and 5.6. As you can see, just changing the Altitude value slightly has completely changed the objects appearance with respect to how it is lit.

Saving and Copying Layer Styles
If you’ve applied a number of Layer Styles to an object and you wish to save the settings to use again in the future, with the source layer selected, click on the icon at the bottom of the Styles panel. The Layer Styles associated with the chosen layer will be saved at a new preset in the Styles panel. If you wish to apply the same Layer Style settings from one layer to another layer, there are a number of ways you can achieve it: •	 Click on the source layer. Go to the Layer menu and choose Layer Style > Copy Layer Style. Click in the target layer in the Layers panel and to the Layer menu and choose Layer Style > Paste Layer Style. •	 Right click on the source layer (not the thumbnail) and choose Copy Layer Style. Click in the target layer and choose Paste Layer Style. •	 Hold down the Alt/Option (PC/Mac) key. Click and drag on the word “Effects” from the source layer to the target layer.

Opacity vs Fill Opacity
There are two different Opacity settings available for every layer; the Opacity and the Fill Opacity. For the most part they appear to perform the same function. However, when you have a Layer Style applied to an object they perform differently with respects to the Layer Style, fig 5.7.

6	 Vector Tools and the Paths Panel
To understand the Vector tools in Photoshop, you must first understand what Vectors are and how they differ from Pixels. Pixels are the basic building blocks of images. They are easy to manipulate and we can apply filters and adjustments to them to change their appearance. Vector based objects are drawn by the program using mathematical co-ordinates to create the shape. The outline that determines the Vector shape is known as a Path.

Fig 6.1 the components of a Vector based object

In fig 6.1 the various components that make up a Vector based object (the Path) have been identified: •	 Selected Anchor Points (often referred to as corner points) – these can be manipulated or moved using the Vector tools. •	 Unselected Anchor – will remain static unless selected. •	 Control Handle – the length of the Control Handle determines the radius of the arc drawn from its Anchor Point. •	 Direction Point – determines the direction of the Vector Path and the Length of the Control Handle.

The Vector tools (fig 6.2) consist of the Pen Tools, The Type Tools, the Vector Selection Tools and the Shape Tools. For the moment, the Pen Tools will not be discussed as they are one the most difficult things to get to grips with in Photoshop. They will be covered in the third book in this series, which covers some of the more advanced features.

The Type Tools
•	 The Horizontal Type Tool – Creates normal, left to right type and is automatically placed in its own Type layer. It is used in two different ways. 1.	 Click in the document to place the type curser and start typing from that point. 2.	 Click and drag with the Type tool to create a text box. When you commence typing, the text will be confined to the inside of the box. •	 The Vertical Type Tool – Works in the same way as the Horizontal Type tool but write from top to bottom. This is useful for Asian characters. •	 The Horizontal and Vertical Type Tools – work in the same way as the previous two tools. However, they don’t create Type layers but instead, create Type shaped selections. You may not have realised that Type consists of Vector information because you cannot edit Type anchor points directly. To customise type you must first convert it to a Vector Shape layer (fig 6.3) or Path.

In fig 6.3 the letter R has been edited to resemble the type used in a popular movie. The method used for creating this custom text will be covered in the next section on using the Path Selection Tools.

The Path Selection Tools
There are two path selection tools (fig 6.2) which are used to move and edit points that make up a Vector Shape or Path. The Path Selection Tool (Black Arrow) – is used to select and move a complete Vector Shape or Path. It is used in a similar way to the standard Move tool and gives you access to the same alignment and distribution functions in the Option panel. It can also be used to quickly duplicate a Vector Shape or Path. Hold down the Alt/Option (PC/Mac) key and drag a Vector shape or Path to create a copy. If you then click and drag with Path Selection Tool, you can create a selection box to encompass both objects. Alternatively, you can hold down the Shift key and click on the second Path to select it. When more than one Vector Shape is selected you can use the alignment and distribution functions in the Option panel to position them accurately, fig 6.4.

The Direct Selection Tool (White Arrow) – use this tool to move and manipulate Shape/Path components.

The Vector Shape Tools
The Vector shape tools are used for creating simple geometric shapes. However, several shapes may be combined to form more complex designs. The Shape Tools may be used to create three different types of object which are chosen from the Option panel, fig 6.5.

•	 The Shape Layer – this consists of a solid colour fill and a Vector based mask that defines the shape. They are automatically created in the Layers panel when this option is chosen •	 The Vector Path – Paths by themselves do not create layers, neither can they be printed. They contain no colour fill or stroke to define them. They are mainly used as guides for other functions. For example, Type may be placed on a Path (fig 6.6), or constrained within a path.

Fig 6.6 create Type on a Path. A method commonly employed in logo design.

•	 Filled Pixel Layers – the Vector Shape tools are used to draw with Pixels. A new blank layer must be created as this option does not generate one automatically as with Shape Layers. There are five standard Shape tools, comprising of: •	 The Rectangle Tool - draws a rectangle. If you wish to create a square, hold down the Shift key as you drag out the shape. •	 The Rounded Rectangle Tool – draws rectangles with rounded corners. The radius of the corners can be changed from the Options panel. •	 The Ellipse Tool - draws an ellipse. If you wish to create a circle, hold down the Shift key as you drag out the shape. •	 The Polygon Tool – draws multi-sided shapes. The number of sides for the shape is entered in the Options panel. •	 The Line Tool – draws a straight line. An arrowhead can be added to the one or both ends of the line. The Arrowhead function is available from the drop down box accessed from the Options panel, fig 6.7.

Editing Vector Shapes and Text
In fig 6.11 a basic Circle was drawn using the Elliptical Shape tool and holding down the Shift key to constrain the proportions. The control handles and direction points are aligned on either side of the Anchor points. However, to create a heart shape we need the top and bottom control handles to form a V shape. The easiest way to do this is to hold down the Alt/Option (PC/Mac) key and use the Direct Selection tool to move one of the direction points. You can then move either of the direction points independently.

Fig 6.11 change a circle into a heart by using the Direct selection tool (white arrow) to manipulate the control handles.

In order to create your own custom Type, it must be converted to a Shape before you can edit it. To do this, go to the Layer menu and choose Type > Convert to Shape. In fig 6.12 you can see a letter P before and after editing. The Anchor points and Direction points were manipulated using the Direct Selection tool and a couple of extra Anchor points were added using the Add Anchor Point tool, fig 6.2. The effect was finished off by adding a few layer styles.

7	 The Brush Tool & Brush Panel
The Brush Tool
Having a good understanding of how the Brush tool works in Photoshop is essential. The same basic principles that are employed in the Brush tool work in a similar fashion for several other tools, such as: •	 The Clonestamp tool •	 The Healing Brush. •	 The Spot Healing Brush •	 The Colour Replacement tool •	 The Mixer Brush •	 The History Brush •	 The Art History Brush •	 The Eraser tool •	 The Background Eraser tool •	 The Blur tool •	 The Sharpen tool •	 The Smudge tool •	 The Dodge tool •	 The Burn tool •	 The Sponge tool Each of these tools will have different properties and options, but once you have learned how the brush tool works you will be able to control how these various tools are applied.

The key properties to understand about the Brush tool are available from the Options panel (fig 7.1) and include: Size – the brush size is measured in pixels and determines the coverage the brush will have. Be aware that on older machines, using very large brushes can cause lag in the rendering of the brush stroke. There are several different ways to change the Brush size: 1.	 Click on the drop down menu in the Options panel fig 7.1, and then move the Size slider. 2.	 With the Brush tool active, hold down the Alt (PC) key and Right click. A preview of the brush will appear in red. Drag left to make the brush smaller and right to make it larger. 3.	 Pressing the left [ key will decrease the brush size and pressing the right ] key will increase the brush size. This is keyboard shortcut is very useful as you can change the brush size on the fly with you left hand whilst painting with your right (or vice versa). 4.	 You can also change the brush size from the Brush panel, fig 7.2 (more on this panel later).

With the Brush tool active, hold down the Alt (PC) key and Right click. A preview of the brush will appear in red. Drag up to make the brush softer and down to make it harder. 3.	 Holding down the Shift key and pressing the left [ key will soften the brush edge and pressing the right ] key will harden the brush edge. 4.	 You can also change the brush Hardness from the Brush panel, fig 7.2.

Opacity – this setting makes the pixels more or less opaque. Making multiple passes with a brush set to a low opacity will gradually build up the pixels opacity until they are 100% opaque. Flow – at low Flow settings, the opacity of the pixels can be built up in a single pass, fig 7.4.

The Brush Panel
The Brush panel (fig 7.2) can be opened from the Window menu if you do not already have it visible in your workspace. At first inspection, the Brush panel can look a little daunting. However, it is not as scary as it first appears when you know that you are just changing the appearance of the Brush Tip and as you make changes to the settings, the result can be seen in the preview section of the bottom of the panel. There are a lot of various “Jitter” settings in this panel and for the word “Jitter” just read “Randomness”. Adding a degree of randomness to your brush strokes can make them appear more natural and painterly and so there are many settings to help you achieve this. To edit a Brush you must click on the property that you wish to change from the list on the left of the panel. Make sure that the box is ticked and that the property is highlighted, by clicking on its name. This will display the settings for that property in the area on the right. NOTE: just ticking the box will not give you access to the settings, the name of the property must be selected.

8	 Layer Masks and Clipping Masks
Layer Masks
Layer masks are an extremely powerful editing tool. They allow non-destructive editing of layers by hiding part of a layer so that the layer underneath can be seen. This is done by adding a Layer Mask to a layer by clicking on the “Add Layer Mask” icon at the bottom of the Layers panel and then painting on the mask using any of the pixels drawing tools such as the Brush tool or the Gradient tool, with black selected as the foreground colour. Painting with black on a mask creates a “Virtual” hole in the current layer. To remove the effects of the mask, switch the foreground colour to white and paint on the mask to erase the hole.

Fig 8.1 two Adjustment layers have been added which have masks already attached.

In fig 8.1 we have a portrait that has had two Adjustment layers added – one to remove the colour information and one to boost the eye colour. The process for creating this effect is as follows: •	 The first Adjustment layer is a Black and White adjustment and was applied by clicking on the “Create new Fill or Adjustment Layer” icon Adjustments panel, fig 8.2. at the bottom of the Layers panel. The settings were then adjusted in the

•	 The Brush tool was then selected and black chosen as the Foreground colour •	 Click on the mask thumbnail in the Layers panel to make it active and then paint over the eyes. By painting with black on the Mask we are creating an area of transparency which allows us to see the colour layer below. •	 The second Adjustment layer is a Photo filter Adjustment with blue selected to enhance the existing eye colour, fig 8.3. However, in this case, instead of want to create a hole to the layer below, we want the opposite of the previous Adjustment layer. We want to apply the Adjustment to the eyes and have the rest of the layer transparent. The easiest was to achieve this, is to go to the Masks panel and click on the Invert button, fig 8.4. The Layer Mask will now appear solid black. This means that the layer is completely transparent.

•	 Select the Brush tool once again, but this time set the foreground colour to White. •	 Click on the mask thumbnail in the Layers panel to make it active and then paint over the eyes. By painting with White on the Mask we are making the layer opaque, and as a result, the effect can now be seen. Layer Masks are great when used to limit the effect of an Adjustment layer as in the previous example. But they can also be used for blending two separate images together. In fig 8.5 we have an image of a church, but the sky is plain and boring. We can use a Layer Mask to remove the existing sky and replace it with one from a completely separate image.


Fig 8.5 the two images we wish to blend together.

Here is the process for replacing the Sky: The first step is to have both of the images open in Photoshop. Whilst looking at the Sky image, select the Move tool from the Tools panel then click and drag the image to the tab that contains the Church image. When the Church image appears continue to drag downwards over the image and then release the mouse. You should then have both images in the same document but on different layers, fig 8.6.

Temporarily hide the Sky layer by clicking on the eyeball icon on the left hand side of the layer. Click on the Church layer to make it active and then choose the Magic Wand tool from the Tools panel. Set the Tolerance value in the Options panel so that when you click on the blue sky it is completely selected but none of the Church is selected, fig 8.7. In this case I found that a Tolerance of 70 worked great, but you may have to experiment a bit with your own images.

The Cloning and Healing Tools

9	 The Cloning and Healing Tools
The cloning and healing tools in Photoshop are very powerful and have many uses such as: •	 Repairing and restoring old photographs. •	 Removing unwanted or distracting elements from an image. •	 Improving portrait and fashion shots by fixing blemishes and creases. •	 Removing sensor dust spots from images. •	 Recomposing an image by relocating elements. •	 Place elements from one image into another image. These tools have made Photoshop famous (and infamous), particularly in the area of retouching fashion and celebrity images. It’s not my place to preach about the moral and ethical issues involved in retouching images. However, I will say that it’s a good idea to consult with the subject before you start trying to make them look 20 years younger (or older) and respect their wishes.

The Healing Tools
The healing tools (fig 9.1) consist of: The Spot Healing Brush tool – this is probably the easiest of the healing tool to get to grips with.

Fig 9.1 the Healing tools

Fig 9.2 the Spot Healing Brush Options panel

The Spot Healing Brush options panel (fig 9.2) has a “Sample All Layers” check box. When selected, it allows you to work non-destructively, by creating a blank layer and using it to contain the edits. When you paint on the blank layer with the Spot Healing Brush, Photoshop will look at the layers below and copy those pixels to the new layer, taking in to account the properties of the brush. The physical properties of the Spot Healing Brush may be altered by using the drop down menu in the Options panel, fig 9.3.

There are three different types of healing which can be selected from the Options panel: 1.	 Proximity Match - heals the target area with the closely surrounding pixels 2.	 Create Texture – works in a similar way to Proximity Match but will attempt to create a texture to match surrounding patterns/noise etc.

3.	 Content Aware – tries to replace the pixels with similar pixels found close by. All of these options will attempt to blend the painted area with its surrounding pixels to create seamless tones. Occasionally, it may take a couple of passes with the brush to get a satisfactory result. The Healing Brush Tool – like the Spot Healing Brush, will also attempt to blend the painted area with the surrounding pixels. How it differs, is that you sample the pixels that you wish to paint with manually. To do this, hold down the Alt/ Option (PC/Mac) and click on a clean area of the image. When you paint, the brush will replace the target pixels with the ones that you’ve sampled and blend them seamlessly, fig 9.4.


Fig 9.4 on the left is a prominent sensor dust spot. On the right we have the same area fixed using the Healing Brush.



An important setting for the Healing Brush tool is the Aligned tick box in the Options panel. When this is ticked, the sample area will move relative to the target area when you paint on a new area. If unchecked the sample area will remain in the same place no matter where you paint in the image. You will usually want to have Aligned ticked to avoid repetitive patterns forming in your image. The Patch Tool – this tool cannot be used in the “Sample all Layers” mode so it will not work in a blank layer. To avoid damaging your original image, select duplicate later from the Layers panel flyout menu, located in the top right hand corner of the panel. The Patch tool is usually used for fixing large areas and has two different modes in the Options panel: 1.	 Source – use the Patch tool to draw a loose selection around the area that you wish to fix. Once you have your completed selection outline, click inside the selected area and drag it to a good part of the image. As you drag the selection you will notice the target area change to reflect the pixels in the area you are currently sampling. When you let go of the mouse button the sample area will be set and the original selected area will be replaced with the sampled area and the surrounding pixels will be blended seamlessly. 2.	 Destination - this mode is the opposite of “Source”. In this instance, you first select a good part of the image and then drag it over the area that you wish to fix.

You can also use the patch tool in conjunction with the Selection tools. Make a selection using any of the Selection tools and then switch to the Patch tool to drag the selection to the sample area. The Redeye Tool – this tool fixes the problem of Redeye caused by on camera flashes, where there appears to be a red glow coming from the subject pupils. To use this tool, simply click and drag to draw a box over the eye. In most case the default settings will do a pretty good job, but if you need to change the settings, you can increase or decrease the Pupil Size and Darken Amount from the Options panel.

The Clone Stamp Tool
The Clone Stamp tool works in a similar fashion to the Healing Brush tool, in that the sample point is set manually by Alt/Option (PC/Mac) clicking. The major difference between these two tools is that Clone Stamp tool does not blend its results with the surrounding pixels. This is invaluable when fixing a portion of an image that contains hard edges. All of the Healing tools would try and blend with the surrounding pixels and blur any edge details in the image, whereas the Clone Stamp tool would allow you to paint right up to those edges without any problem. Another advantage of the Clone Stamp tool over the Healing tools, is that you can assign any brush tip shape. This means that you can use the Brush panel to create textured and randomized brushes to use with the Clone Stamp tool.

Selections

10	Selections
In the first book in this series, we looked at a number of the basic selection tools. In this chapter we will expand on that knowledge by looking at alternative ways to make selections and also methods of manipulating and refining selections.

Quick selection tool
The Quick Selection tool (fig10.1), is like painting a selection onto the image. The tool will attempt to follow edges of high contrast in order to make a selection. There is little in the way of controls for this tool, but there are buttons that allow you to add to and subtract from your current selection, fig 10.2.

Fig 10.1 the Quick Selection Tool is found grouped with the Magic Wand tool in the Tools panel

Fig 10.2 add or subtract selection areas by choosing one of the settings in the Options panel

The Auto Enhance check box in the Options panel adds a slight amount of smoothing to the selection edge, making it less blocky. The accuracy of the Quick Selection tool is largely dependent on the brush size. Typically, the smaller the brush size, the more accurate the selection will be. The Quick Selection tool is often a good place to start when making a selection. However, it will often need to be used in conjunction with other selection tools or the Refine Edge function, to provide an accurate selection.

Refine Edge
The Refine Edge function can be accessed from the Options panel when you choose any of the selection tools and you have an active selection. It can also be accessed from the Select menu. When Refine Edge is chosen a dialogue box will appear which will allow you to edit the current selection, fig 10.3.

Transform Selections
In chapter 3 of this book we looked at Transformations. It is also possible to Transform selections using the same methods and modifiers. However, to transform a selection you must access the function from the Select menu and not the Edit menu. Another difference is that you don’t have access to the different Transformation types from the Select menu. However, you can still access them by Right clicking inside Transformation bounding box or using the Modifier keys.

Saving and Loading Selections
Once you’ve gone to the trouble of making a complex selection it’s a good idea to save it in case you wish to return to the document at a later date to re-edit it. The Save and Load selections function can be found in the Select menu. Once you save a selection, a new Channel is created and can be viewed and edited in the Channels panel.

Color Range
This selection method is available from the Select menu. There is also a Color Range function which can be used to edit Layer Masks and works in the same fashion. It is very useful for selecting areas of strong colour such as skies, fig 10.7.

Selections

Fig 10.7 the Color Range dialogue box.

The Color Range dialogue box is used by choosing the eyedropper tool and either clicking in the image or corresponding selection area in the preview panel of the dialogue box. The original selection can be added to by using the + eyedropper or subtracted from using the – eyedropper. The selection can be adjusted using the Fuzziness slider to add or subtract similar colours. The selection can also be Localized to the original sample point and the surrounding area by using the “Localized Color Clusters” check box in association with the Range slider. The “Select” drop down menu can be useful to target specific colours or Shadow, Midtone and Highlight areas of an image for editing.

Image & Canvas Resizing

11	Image & Canvas Resizing
Resizing a Document
The ability to resize a document is extremely important. We often need smaller versions for web pages, layouts and emailing. Resizing is accomplished by choosing “Image Size” in the Image menu.

Fig 11.1 the Image Size dialogue box.

The Image Size dialogue box (fig 11.1) appears straight forward, but is often used incorrectly: •	 Pixel Dimensions – this option will only be available if the Resample Image check box is ticked. Please note that this is a destructive process and you should perform this process on a copy of your original document, so that the original will remain safe. If you increase the Pixel Dimensions, Photoshop will try to invent new image information in a process called interpolation. When the Pixel Dimensions are reduced, information is lost from the document. •	 Document Size – you can change the physical dimensions of a document without using the Resample Image check box. However, it will accomplish this by changing the documents resolution. For example, if I made a document 200% of the original size, the resolution of the document would be reduced to half of the original setting, fig 11.2.

Image & Canvas Resizing

Resample Image – there are five different algorithms that can be selected if you need to resample the document, fig 11.3. They each have a description in parenthesis as to when they should be chosen, with the exception of Bilinear. Bilinear interpolation works by averaging the colour values surrounding a given pixel and produces medium quality results. The three Bicubic algorithms generally produce the best results.

Fig 11.3 the various interpolation algorithms employed during Resampling.

Adding Canvas Area
You can add to the canvas area of a document in two different ways. The first method involves choosing the Canvas Size function in the Image menu. The resulting dialogue box is relatively simple to use. Enter the new Width and Height settings and then click in the box containing the arrows to indicate the edges you wish to resizes – clicking in the middle will add canvas to all sides, fig 11.4.

Before you click OK, use the drop down menu in the “Canvas extension color” section to choose the colour of the new canvas area.

The second method for altering the canvas area involves the use of the crop tool. However, instead of cropping inwards, you use the tool to drag outwards. The new canvas area will be the colour that you currently have set as the background colour. Once you have set the crop area to the new size, click on the Tick in the Options panel to accept the changes.

The Filter Gallery

12	The Filter Gallery
The Filters are found in the Filters menu and there are generally two uses for Filters in Photoshop. The first is to retouch the image and involves Filters in the Lens Correction, Blur, Sharpen and Noise categories. The second use is to produce special effects. It is often difficult to visualise what these special effects type filter are going to do, so Photoshop provides the Filter Gallery which has small thumbnails next to each effect to give you an idea as to the function of the Filter, fig 12.1.

Fig 12.1 the Filter Gallery

Not all of the Filters available in Photoshop appear in the Filter Gallery. It tends to be the more artistic that are included. Before you apply a Filter it is good practice to convert the Layer for Smart Filters (in the Filters menu). This creates a Smart Object from the current Layer and as such, will apply the Filters non-destructively. This also means that you can re-open the Filter at any time and change the settings. This is achieved by double clicking on the Filter Gallery name in the Layers panel, fig 12.2.

Another advantage of using the Filter Gallery is the Ability to stack multiple Filters and preview the results, fig 12.3. To add more Filters, click on the icon on the bottom right of the dialogue box. Initially the current effect will be duplicated, but you can change it by clicking on a different effect in the Filter Gallery. You can change the order in which the effects are applied by dragging them up or down in the list.

Grouping Layers
The process of making complex edits can generate a large number of layers, fig 13.1. In web and design layouts with lots of graphics and type layers the number of layers can easily top one hundred. It is good practice to keep an orderly Layer panel by naming layers and Grouping similar layers into folders. In fig 13.2 the image edits have been grouped into Tonal and Colour adjustments, which makes for a much tidier Layers panel.

More on Layers

There are a couple of different ways of grouping layers into folders. My preferred method is to first select multiple layers by clicking on the lowest layer to be placed in a group and then hold down the Shift key and click on the uppermost layer, the selected layers will then appear blue, fig 13.3.

Fig 13.3 multiple selected layers

Once the layers have been selected, go to the flyout menu in the top right hand corner of the Layers panel and choose the “New Group from Layers” option, fig 13.4. A dialogue box will appear (fig 13.5) in which you can name the Group, assign it a colour and also set the Blend mode and Opacity for the Group.
