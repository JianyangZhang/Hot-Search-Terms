Introduction

INTRODUCTION
Information within large companies (multinationals) is usually extracted from separate registration systems which support specific business functions such as production planning, warehousing, financial accounting and personnel administration. Many companies wish to integrate their business processes. Process integration reflects the change from a functional organisation towards a process oriented organisation. The integration is not only within the company, but also beyond the borders of the organisation. The external process integration with customers and vendors uses Customer Relationship Management and Supplier Relationship Management. The cooperation with other companies is done with Supply Chain Management and Product Lifecycle Management. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrates logistics, financial and human resources in one system. (See Figure A)

Figure A ERP system and disciplines

SAP ERP is a software system developed by the SAP AG that covers almost all transaction requirements and business functions of a company. For specific branches such as the airline industry, health care, the chemical industry and the retail industry, within SAP ERP the so-called Industry Solutions can be activated. With the introduction of SAP Business Suite the SAP ERP system is extended with a Customer Relations Management system (CRM), Supplier Relationship Management (SRM), Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), Strategic Enterprise Management (SEM) based on the Business Warehouse (BW). NetWeaver enables the integration between the components and other administration and production control systems. A portal enables users to activate all the systems with a single logon.

Introduction

IDES, the International Demonstration and Evaluation System, has been developed by SAP. IDES provides a huge data base which enables the simulation of many different business scenarios within the SAP systems. Many business scenarios are described in the IDES help application. The IDES system is used worldwide by SAP for training purposes. This course is an introduction to ERP supported by SAP, SAP ERP and IDES. The method has been developed for use in business schools and universities. Knowledge of the subjects related to ERP is assumed. The method is not focusing on the different modules of SAP ERP, but on the main characteristic of SAP ERP: the integration of business processes. The course is divided into three parts: Part 1 Enterprise Resource Planning and SAP. Part 2	Carrying out a complete ERP process. Part 3	Special applications. Part one, Enterprise Resource Planning and SAP, deals with Enterprise Resource Planning and the company, SAP AG, which developed the SAP systems. The technical aspects of the SAP ERP system are illustrated and a description of SAP is given. Part two focuses on a complete ERP process. The assignments in the chapters deal with logistics, financial and human resources. Each chapter starts with a short introduction and a process outline. In chapter 14 a sales order-driven process is presented. By means of material requirements planning (MRP I) all steps of the business cycle are carried out and are offering experiences typical for working with ERP and SAP ERP. The data of chapters 9-13 are applied in this ERP process. In part three, special applications such as fixed assets, controlling, product costing, production on stock with forecast based planning and human resource management are introduced.

1	 ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING
Enterprise Resource Planning software will be explained in this chapter. Attention is given to the advantages and disadvantages of ERP software. Enterprise Resource Planning can be considered as follow-up development coming out of Material Resource Planning. The functions of Enterprise Resource Planning are presented in a diagram and are explained in the text. The flow of goods and the transformations they may undergo are explained in paragraph 1.4. In paragraph 1.6 the flow of goods is linked with Enterprise Resource Planning.

1.1	 ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SOFTWARE
Enterprise Resource Planning software (ERP software) can be defined as software supporting the whole range of operations by processing the information associated with goods flows and financial flows.

Enterprise Resource Planning

ERP software above all has an important added value since it facilitates integrated recording of information throughout the organization. The information kept on record by an organization is generic to a significant extent and can therefore easily be accommodated within a standard package. In the past, each department installed its own computer system. The personnel department used a personnel management system, the financial administration an accounting package, while several planning and warehouse systems were in use in the production department. The separate systems often worked to the complete satisfaction of departmental users, but the links between these systems led to many problems, high cost levels and poor flexibility. An integrated ERP package offers a solution to this problem.

Figure 1.1 Enterprise Resource Planning in SAP ERP

A large production company will be able in general to get by with a system for office automation (e.g. MSOffice), an ERP package (for example SAP ERP) and some highly specialized software in the field of process automation (for example CAD/CAM systems). The development of ERP software is a booming business. The wealth of advertisements and job recruitment sites like www.monsterboard.nl in publications specializing in computer and information specialist recruitment indicates a great demand for SAP consultants, Baan experts, etc. SAP (SAP ERP and R/3) was in 2013 with a market share of 26% still the market leader. Oracle, who took over Peoplesoft and JD Edwards, is number two.

Enterprise Resource Planning

ERP systems attempt to offer a fully integrated solution for the management of financial flows, goods flows and information flows within organizations. Many ERP systems have their roots in production planning. This is sometimes apparent from the fact that the production module is significantly better developed than the other modules. The original nature of the production (discrete vs. process industry) often has a distinct impact over contemporary software. Baan and BPCS for instance come from the discrete industry sector, in which the emphasis lies on bills of materials management and material requisition planning. SAP originally comes from the financial sector and has consequently developed functionality features centred on production and logistics. Nearly all the large players in the market are converging with respect to functionality of the ERP package. Meanwhile SAP and Baan have process modules designed to support the process industry.

1.2	 ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING AS A FOLLOW-UP TO MRP
ERP is also seen as a supplement to MRP II. In the Material Requirements Planning concept (MRP I) a demand forecast is drawn up on the basis of bills of materials, calculated according to range of production orders and purchasing orders expected. Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) was a later extension. This concept represents an expansion of MRP I into a more integrated planning and management concept. MRP II for instance also takes into account the available production capacities. MRP I and MRP II are compatible for use within a single organization. Increasingly far-reaching internationalization means that management must take place ‘over the heads of individual plants’. Mutual deliveries between organizational units are included in the concept, for instance. ERP is compatible with this. The functionality of ERP software has been drastically expanded over recent years to include Customer Relation Management (CRM), sales support, supply chain management, workflow management, human resources management, etc. This trend continues; ERP software is further expanding its borders. Nearly all operational functions are now supported.

1.3	 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF ERP
Some of the advantages have already been discussed above. The most important of these are: •	 Integration: the coherence between processes is seamlessly supported. Island automation is no longer an issue. Integration reduces problems caused by redundancy and errors in the data. •	 Process orientation: instead of supporting activities in departments, ERP orientates itself towards operational processes that take place throughout the whole of the organization (and outside it), and indeed you see this in so-called Workflow Management solutions that the ERP systems offer. These cater to the support and direction of operational processes.

Enterprise Resource Planning

•	 Openness: ERP systems can communicate with other systems; this means that the Supply Chain concept, a far-reaching chain integration into the industrial process, can be utilized. ERP systems can also communicate with other systems, such as Customer Relationship Management software (CRM). •	 State-of-the-art: the research being carried out by ERP suppliers is sufficiently comprehensive to ensure that a company using an ERP system can be confident that the functionality will both continue to be available and continue to be expanded. Associations of users often have some influence on aspects of functionality earmarked for expansion or improvement. •	 Industrial sector orientation: ERP suppliers ensure that their software supports various sectors of industry. This support (called Industry Solutions) is constantly being expanded. •	 Internationalization: ERP can be used supra-locational, supra-organizational and beyond national borders. This is an ideal solution for multinationals, since data taken from all their subsidiaries needs to be consolidated. ERP is not a universal panacea. Naturally there are some disadvantages to the introduction of a system such as this. You might like to consider the following, for instance: •	 High costs: the price of the software license is fairly high. The consultancy costs involved in the implementation of an ERP package exceed the license cost by a factor of approximately 2–4. A Dutch theme park, for instance, recently implemented an ERP system at a cost of about €3.5 million, of which €0.5 million was for the software license. •	 Lengthy implementation: the time taken for making enhancements, customizing and the implementation often exceeds a year. Accelerated implementation techniques, Accelerated SAP, are available however, under which a selection is made of best practices in the implementation, where the need for labour-intensive fine tuning of the software is partly eliminated. In this case processes in the organization (as regards its operational processes) are adapted to the software. A solution like this is welcomed particularly by smaller organizations. In the case of medium and small companies, an implementation of this kind takes something in the order of 3 to 6 months, depending on the complexity involved. •	 No tailor-made solution: ERP remains a standard solution: the user may have to modify his expectations as far as his package of requirements is concerned. Tailor-made systems are generally much more expensive than standard software. Modifications made to standard software are costly and can cause problems with upgrades. For that reason it becomes the policy of some companies to avoid modifications during the implementation.

Enterprise Resource Planning

Since the 1990s we have seen more organizations transferring to standard software. On the one hand, each company is individually aware of its own unique operational processes, yet these unique points are often remnants from the past. There is something to be said for taking a look to see whether the best practice options, which ERP systems offer, are not in fact better than one’s own solutions. Why should my organization differ from the many other companies in my sector that have already been studied? Moreover, are my (unique) deviations from the general pattern as regards operational processes really as necessary as I think they are? The employee learning period for new functionality in an ERP package is, as a matter of fact, generally much shorter than in cases where a totally new software package is acquired.

1.4	 FUNCTIONS OF ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING
Figure 1.2 shows the most important functions that can be used by an ERP system in corporate operations. In this overview, the supporting functions are grouped around the logistics, the primary processes. The central feature is the flow of goods from the supplier to the customer: procurement results in the receipt and storage of raw materials (triangle), the various raw materials are processed during production into finished product units; these are subsequently delivered to the customer from stock. The way in which content is given to the primary processes of procurement, sales, stock control, shop floor control and manufacturing, is market and product specific. The flow of goods from the supplier to the customer is counterbalanced by a cash flow in the opposite direction: from the customer to the supplier. Recording of this cash flow takes place in the accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) sub-administrations and in the ledger administration (general ledger).

The relationship between the flow of goods and the cash flow constitutes the value cycle of an organization. The non-shaded functions form the secondary, supporting activities. Treasury, asset management and consolidation support the management and planning of financial resources over the short and long term. Workflow management, planning and control, human resources, service management and customer relations management support the logistics processes. In Figure 1.3 the central focus is on the flow of goods. The planning levels and logistic modules are shown.

Enterprise Resource Planning

In sales and distribution (SD) the sales statistics for the previous year form the basis for establishing a sales forecast for the coming year. This sales forecast makes up the demand for production capacity. By gearing the availability of capacity to sales demand, provision is made for the necessary capacity within the production planning (PP) by establishing both the nominative capacity and the expected annual capacity (year capacity plan and capacity allocation). The planning of the annual capacity constitutes the basis for establishing the main production plan within PP, as well as the basis for setting up the necessary procurement within Materials Management (MM). The master production plan has a planning horizon of one year and consists of production objectives relating to product units per period. The master production plan thereby creates a procurement requirement for raw materials/ components. This requirement is met by establishing a procurement plan. The master production plan is converted into a detailed production plan, with a planning horizon of less than one year. The planning quantities are the number of units to be produced and the number of production orders. Even at this level, sales figures are coordinated according to production objectives and procurement. The planned production orders are converted into actual production orders, raw materials/components are issued and processed into finished products. The finished products are made available for delivery to the customer by MM. The planning for distribution to customers, which is also factored into this, takes place from within sales and distribution, SD. The Supply Chain concept is central in SAP ERP: the chain from the original supplier to the final consumer has to be managed. By bringing optimum co-ordination to the flow of information, the flow of goods and the cash flow, a maximum customer response is achieved at minimum cost according to SAP. It is possible for a customer, to gain information from the Internet regarding the products of a particular company, to adapt your own products accordingly and to place an order. This order then automatically ends up in SAP ERP; where necessary, this package automatically generates orders to suppliers (multi-company planning) and even initiates the necessary processes within the organization of a company. In this way, open systems can be linked to each other and transactions extended over various individual companies.

1.5	 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
The Supply Chain comprises all activities that have to do with the flow of goods and the transformations they may undergo, all the way from raw materials through to the end user, complete with the associated information flows (see Figure 1.4).

Figure 1.4 Chain from supplier to consumer

We are concerned here in fact with the activities that take place within the manufacturing process. In the case of simple products, this supply chain can readily be identified and surveyed, but when you think of the automobile industry, for instance, the situation is very complex. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is therefore the control and integration of these activities by making use of all kinds of cross connections and networks in order to achieve a significant competitive advantage. The chain goes upstream in a supplier network and downstream in a distribution network (customers). The supplier network consists of all the companies that provide an input in any way whatsoever; these inputs could be physical raw materials, but they could also be information, for instance. In the case of the automobile industry, this chain would represent a supplier network of thousands of companies supplying goods ranging from steel and plastics, but also including complete gearboxes, brake systems, car radios and similar. Even the production of these gearboxes etc. is part of the supply chain. Some authors say that when looking for the start of a supply chain you always come back to Mother Earth. The main point, however, is that each supply chain consists of a (generally large) series of linked suppliers and customers; each customer becomes a supplier in the next link of the supply chain until the product reaches the end user. Seen from within an individual company, you can say that the three SCM perspectives are: 1.	 internal functions (transforming inputs into outputs); 2.	 upstream supplier functions; 3.	 downstream customer functions.

Enterprise Resource Planning

The management challenge is that coordination takes place between these three aspects in such a way that the company maintains its right to exist within the supply chain. 1.	 Internal functions Where the internal functions are concerned, these relate to various operational processes, including the transformation processes of raw materials or semimanufactures into finished products. These raw materials or semi-manufactures are supplied by the suppliers and the finished products are supplied to the distribution channel (the dealer organization in the case of the automobile industry). Orders from purchasers of automobiles must be translated into production orders. It is easy to imagine for instance that in the case of large freight lorries (as with DAF), this takes place on a one-to-one basis. Each customer order = one production order = one freight lorry. Even with private vehicles, things are beginning to move in the direction of production on demand. On deciding to purchase a new car, for instance, you can now specify the version, the colour and whether it should have air-conditioning, etc. The influence of the final consumer over the production is steadily increasing. The sales order data are very detailed: quotation prices, latest possible delivery dates, delivery scenarios, etc. Production planning is also extremely important. Use can be made of MRP here. 2.	 Upstream supplier functions This refers to functions that take place outside the individual organization. Upstream is the procurement function. You think here of the selection of suppliers who can meet our requirements and wishes and who are reliable when it comes to delivery. The maintenance of good relations with suppliers is extremely important. In SCM, you see contacts with suppliers fanning out into the product development, commercial office, warehouse and administration departments and so on. In this situation, there is close contact with the suppliers from within the internal operational processes.

3.	 Downstream customer functions These functions comprise all distribution channels and processes used in facilitating the flow of products to the final customer. In most cases, it involves matters such as storage, transport, and sales activities. SCM is orientated towards the control between various components in the supply chain. Five levels of integration are identified within SCM: 1.	 standardization of master financial data; 2.	 standardization of master logistics data; 3.	 exchange of time-dependent data; 4.	 standardization of planning and control procedures; 5.	 supply chain planning. The fifth level can only be reached after the preceding levels have been completed. Supply Chain Management can (and also will) lead to a curtailment of the number of links in the industrial column. This is clarified in figure 1.4.

It is naturally the business of a particular company to ensure that it is not pushed out of the supply chain.

1.6	 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT AND ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING
Supply Chain Management has primarily to do with the building up and maintenance of close ties with suppliers and customers. You see that this is made possible by developments in ICT (Information and Communication Technology). SCM is therefore both relationshipbased and technology-driven, to use a few words of ‘newspeak’. A combination of ERP and Internet (E-Business/E-Commerce) provides many options for the successful use of SCM. The advent of these technologies even makes a worldwide supply chain possible. As an example you can take the DOW Chemical Company, an industrial undertaking with branches in 168 countries and an annual turnover of more than $50 billion in something like 3,100 products in the chemicals, plastics and agricultural sectors. The company employs 45,000 people and has 150 production locations in 35 countries. The most important aspect of SCM for DOW is that the company tries to offer consumers what they want at an acceptable cost (an acceptable price). The company has a Supply Chain Technology Center (based at Terneuzen in the Netherlands and at other locations worldwide) that will be responsible for cross-pollination between best practices and new technologies. The Center also scans for best practices and new technologies which DOW can also make use of. The deployment of ERP and a strong focus on operational processes is an important outcome of the Center’s activities.

Enterprise Resource Planning

Modern ERP systems integrate the planning, control and monitoring of processes within an organization. Because the internal flow of information between important departments within a company is integrally coordinated by ERP, it is possible to bring products to the market quicker, reduce costs and guarantee the loyalty of customers and suppliers. Using the right ERP system, a company can expand its ability to monitor its activities to the whole of the supply chain. The initiative of SAP in relation to Supply Chain Management (SAP SCM), for instance, covers all aspects of supply chain integration. SCM solutions are on hand within SAP in the form of APO, Advanced Planner and Optimizer, and LES, Logistics Execution System. APO is responsible for improved demand forecasting and increased efficiency in production processes. LES facilitates more efficient, rapid and accurate flow of goods in the supply chain.

3.2	ANALYTICS
SAP ERP is also a complete integrated solution for analyses and business intelligence, including strategic enterprise management (SEM) and financial, operational and personnel analyses. It enables companies to understand the links between profit and strategic and operational performances. The Business Balanced Scorecard is one of the analytical possibilities which are offered by SEM. Financial analytics enables you to define financial targets, develop a realistic business plan, and monitor costs and revenue during execution. Operational analytics enables you to compile detailed operations reports and support informed operational decision making. Workforce analytics support human capital management policy development and decision making. Figure 3.2 describes the possibilities of the various forms of Analytics.

3.3	FINANCIALS
SAP ERP Financials provides a complete financial management solution for a broad range of industries. The solution offers depth of functionality in accounting, reporting, analysis, financial supply chain, corporate governance and treasury management. In the new concept within SAP ERP is profit centre accounting, determination of the costs of goods sold, special valuation accounts and consolidation accounts integrated. This integration supports the need for the multi-dimensional valuation and reports from various points of view, such as the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) international versus local, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance (SOX) and supports the reporting according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The solution gives depth of the functionality in accounting, reporting, analyses, financial supply chain and treasury management. Financial and management reporting plus internal controls and documentation make possible a good level of business analytics. Figure 3.3 describes the various possibilities of the financials.

3.4	 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
To meet the demands of today’s knowledge-based economy, companies must maximize the potential and productivity of their employees. Maximizing the investment in the organization’s human capital is crucial to business success. This requires transforming the HR function from an administration department into a strategic contributor of human capital management strategies. Modern HR departments must deliver a contribution to improve the efficiency and productivity of the employees. Figure 3.4 describes the possibilities of the various forms of Human Capital.

4	 ORGANIZATION DEPICTED IN SAP ERP
There are a number of concepts that form the basic framework of SAP. These concepts, like the corporate structure, are important. All the information within the system is grouped according to this structure. The concepts are explained in this chapter. The sorts of data in SAP are distinguished first. Next the organizational structure used in SAP ERP is described, and the hierarchy that functions as a backbone in SAP ERP is illustrated. You will use entity relation diagrams (ERD) to depict the relations and links between the different concepts.

4.1	 SORTS OF DATA
You can distinguish two sorts of data, namely transaction data and master data. Transaction data register the daily business transactions. Think in terms of regular sales orders, purchase orders, invoices, production orders and suchlike. SAP gives every document pertaining to a transaction a document number. With transaction data, there are usually a number of related documents, which together register a particular process. A sales process may, for example, involve a quotation, followed by an order, a delivery and a payment. Master data Master data are relatively fixed data within a system. In SAP ERP client files, staff files, material files, routings and account schemes are examples of master data. Master data usually have different aspects; these are called views or infotypes. A material always has master data, but storage and accounting data about a particular material can also be stored. You then add views to the ma-terial. A member of staff has an address, but also a particular salary and maybe family members. In SAP, these are called infotypes included in employee master data.

4.2	 ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE PROJECTED IN SAP ERP
By defining clients, the administration of several concerns can be conducted within one installation of SAP. With clients, a distinction can be made between the actual business and test or practice businesses that are used to test a new module or to train the work force. By constructing a ‘practice client’, members of staff can practice with the business data to their hearts’ content without influencing the actual business operation.

Organization depicted in SAP ERP

Client The client is the highest organizational level (Figure 4.1). There is usually only one client for the entire organization/concern. Several clients could be used for different organizations using the same SAP ERP installation, or for testing and training. Clients have separate and unrelated data. Company Each client can contain a number of companies. A company is often used for the subsidiary companies within a concern. Each company is identified as unique by an alphanumeric code of four characters, and is intended as an organizationally and legally independent entity, with its own balance and revenue accountability. SAP makes automatic consolidation possible of the financial accounting for all businesses that have a client. It is also possible to consolidate several clients by using the ‘legal consolidation’ module.

Controlling area A controlling area is an organizational unit within a company, used to represent a closed system for cost accounting purposes. A controlling area may include single or multiple company codes that may use different currencies. These company codes must use the same operative chart of accounts. All internal allocations refer exclusively to objects in the same controlling area. Operating concern Operating concerns are the accountability areas within a business that are used for the allocation of costs to cost centers. Each cost center is allocated to an operating concern. Each operating concern can represent more than one company.

Plant Businesses can also be subdivided into operational facilities called plants, which are used in the logistic module. Various storage locations can be allocated to each plant. Plants and business areas are not mutually exclusive. For example, a plant can make various products, which are paid for in different business areas. In the same way, a business area can handle products from various plants. Storage location The organizational unit storage location can consist of various storage areas. Storage locations allow the differentiation between the various stocks of a material in a plant. The units are important for the valuation (FI) and planning (PP).

4.3	 PROJECTING THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE IN SAP ERP
Usually, there is more than one way of depicting the concepts/departments as they exist in the enterprise. The different possible representations will, however, have certain consequences. If a particular alternative is simpler to implement, the result of this will frequently be that certain information needed in the longer term cannot be obtained from the system. Conversely, a more complex alternative will have the consequence that more information can be obtained from the system, but the users will need more training to use the system properly and to interpret the information correctly.
Example 4.1 A university has decided that each faculty be depicted in SAP as a company with a company code, instead of having one company code for the whole university.

Once a particular set-up has been chosen, it may be difficult to change it. Due consideration should therefore be given to this set-up: it is important not only to look at current information needs, but also the information that the system may be required to process in the future.

4.4	 SAP HIERARCHY
Within SAP, there are a number of concepts which can be considered as the framework of the system. They form the so-called ‘corporate structure’ or organizational structure. These concepts are important because all information that is registered in the system is linked to these concepts. Many of these concepts will be explained in this chapter. In the first place, the SAP hierarchy is explained; this can be considered to serve as the backbone for the concepts. Then the concepts of the most important modules will be illustrated. In doing this you will use ERDs (Entity-Relation-Diagrams) to clarify the relation /allocations between the separate concepts. In the ERD there is an indication of which concepts are related to each other and whether there are any ‘n-on-m’ relations. Client The highest level distinguished is that of the client. On logging in, this must be instantiated. Each client is a detached, individual work environment. Frequently, within one enterprise use is made of a production environment (the actual system), a training environment and a test environment. Nearly all customizing activities are related to one client. In other words, an activity only affects the client in which a user is working.

Company code The most important concept within a client is the company code. A company code represents an independent legal entity with fiscal obligations. All data relating to the flow of funds are linked to the company code (see Figure 4.4). All separate financial concepts should ultimately lead to one balance sheet and one profit and loss statement, which is sent to the tax authorities (and the shareholders). The most important data that are recorded are the following: 1.	 Chart of Accounts (general ledger accounting) 2.	 Currency 3.	 Address

Figure 4.4 SAP hierarchy

Plant The plant is the concept to which logistical data are linked. As Figure 4.4 shows, there is an allocation from the plant to the company code. This means that the financial consequences of a logistical process can be passed on directly (provided they have been implemented) to the financial modules. In setting up a plant, only the address must be entered. At a later stage, all sorts of control parameters will be linked to the plant. Control data are data that determine how the system reacts in different situations.
Example 4.2 Various sorts of materials will be entered in various general ledger accounts in the accounts scheme. This takes place by means of control parameters.

HANDS-ON WITH SAP ERP AND IDES

Organization depicted in SAP ERP

Storage location Storage locations are used for the stock registration of materials. With a storage location, only a code and a specification are recorded. The reason that no address is recorded is that it is assumed that the storage location is situated in the same place as the plant. Storage locations are important in SAP for very complicated stock registrations, production planning (PP) and requirement planning. The modules concerned will not be discussed in this chapter.

4.5	 FINANCIAL (FI)
The organization structures in Financial can be subdivided into: •	 Group company •	 Controlling area •	 Profit centre Group company If a company has a number of subsidiary companies, it is also obliged to issue consolidated annual accounts. By way of the group company SAP provides the possibility of having this consolidation executed entirely by the system. Naturally, adjustments will have to be made here too (for example, to exclude reciprocal deliveries between parent company and subsidiary etc.). These adjustments are linked to the group company.

Figure 4.5 Group company

Controlling area An organizational unit within a company, used to represent a closed system for cost accounting purposes. A controlling area may include single or multiple company codes that may use different currencies. These company codes must use the same operative chart of accounts. All internal allocations refer exclusively to objects in the same controlling area.

Figure 4.6 Controlling area

Example 4.3 A international enterprise has several subsidiaries in the Netherlands. Cost can be analysed per country with the use of a controlling area for the Netherlands.

Profit center As can be seen from Figure 4.7, the profit center is an unrelated concept, not linked to any other concept. A profit center is used to produce balances and Profit and Loss accounts. The profit center is not an independent legal entity. It does not therefore have to comply with the legal requirements for external accounting.

Figure 4.7 Profit center

In a company, it is often standard practice to assign some profit accountability to departments. This profit is generated by the services/products that they deliver to other departments or customers. By using profit centers this can be registered in SAP.
Example 4.4 An international enterprise can analyze the costs and revenues per product group by creating within the controlling area the next profit centers: Printers, Desktops and Laptops.

4.6	 MATERIAL MANAGEMENT (MM)
Purchasing organization All data relating to suppliers, delivery addresses and conditions of payment are allocated to the purchasing organization. Figure 4.8 shows that there is an allocation both with the financial concepts and with the logistical concepts. In the case of procurement and suppliers, both financial and logistical information is recorded. Of course, a purchasing organization can only be allocated one company code. The conditions of payment and receipt of goods are accordingly entered in one account scheme. A company may have several purchasing organizations. The subdivision into several purchasing organizations may, for example, be based on location or on the sort of products that are being purchased.

Furthermore, it is possible to make purchases for several plants. It can also occur that a plant can be served by several purchasing organizations. Although it is not indicated in the ERD in Figure 4.8 that there is a relationship between the plant and the company code, nevertheless, it does exist. The fact is that the purchasing organization can only be linked to the plants that fall under the same company code. If that were not the case, the system would not know under which company code which part of the profit should be entered.
Example 4.5 A wholesaler supplies car components (batteries, towbars and tires) to repair companies. It has three distribution centers for this in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven, where the purchasing department is located. Its activities are subdivided into batteries, towbars and tires. In SAP, this is realized by using three plants (= three logistical streams), one for each distribution center. In addition, three purchasing organizations have been set up which are subdivided into the various product groups. Each purchasing organization is linked to each plant, so that each distribution center can be furnished with the various product groups.

4.7	 SALES AND DISTRIBUTION (SD)
The organization structures in Sales and Distribution can be subdivided into three groups: •	 Externally oriented sales organization •	 Internally oriented sales organization •	 Distribution
4.6.1	 EXTERNALLY ORIENTED SALES ORGANIZATION

Sales organization This is an organization unit that is responsible for the sale of particular products or services. This sales unit also has legal liability in relation to damages. A complete sales transaction takes place within one sales organization. (This sales translation consists of quotation ⇒ order ⇒ delivery ⇒ invoice). Often, sales organizations mirror the division of a particular market geographically.

Figure 4.9 Sales organization

Example 4.6 The wholesaler mentioned before supplies his products to car repair companies located all over the Netherlands. For this purpose, there are three sales organizations operating in the northern, central and southern Netherlands, respectively.

Distribution channels A distribution channel denotes the manner in which products or services arrive at the customer. A more usual term for distribution channel is sales route. As the diagram shows, one distribution channel can be used in several sales organizations. A sales organization can make use of several distribution channels.

Figure 4.10 Distribution channel

Organization depicted in SAP ERP

Example 4.7 The wholesaler makes use of three different distribution channels: •	 Internet •	 Franchise chains •	 Other garages All three sales organizations use the channel franchise chains and other garages. Sales organization central Netherlands also delivers via the Internet.

A Distribution channel also has an allocation with a Plant. Each sales organization is free to determine Distribution channels, through which the plants can be supplied. For the combination of Distribution channel and sales organization it can therefore be established from which plant (or plants) supplies can be provided. A Distribution channel can get supplies from several plants, and a plant can have several Distribution channels allocated to it.
Example 4.8 Central Netherlands supplies by Internet from Rotterdam or Eindhoven. The necessary assignments are: •	 Internet – Central Netherlands – Rotterdam •	 Internet – Central Netherlands – Eindhoven

Division A division is used to group materials, products or services. A material is grouped in one division. Price agreements with a particular client can be allocated to these groupings. In addition, sales statistics can be generated per division. Divisions can be used in several sales organizations, while within one sales organization products from several divisions can be sold.

Organization depicted in SAP ERP

Example 4.9 The products are divided into three divisions: Batteries, Tow bars and Tires (these are the same divisions as in the Purchasing department). Tires are sold in each sales organization. Batteries are not sold in Southern Netherlands, tow bars are not sold in Northern Netherlands.

Sales area The sales area diverges from the three concepts named above. In fact, in the case of a sales organization, distribution channel and a division, a code and a description are established. With a sales area this is not established. A sales area is understood to be the combination of one sales organization, one Distribution channel and one division. This consists therefore of one allocation. With the sales area it is established through which distribution channels a group of materials (division) can be delivered. In view of the fact that this can vary per sales organization, it is established per sales organization. The distribution channels and divisions are already allocated to the sales organization. The allocation of the distribution channel and the division within the sales organization can thus only be effected with the distribution channels and the divisions that are allocated to the sales organization concerned.

Figure 4.12 Sales area

Example 4.10 For the Central Netherlands sales organization you have the following distribution channels (see the examples above): Internet, Franchise chains and other garages. Furthermore, there are the following divisions: Batteries, Tow bars, Tires.

4.6.2	 INTERNALLY ORIENTED SALES ORGANIZATION

These concepts describe how the sales department can be organized within the company (with respect to accountability etc.): •	 Sales office •	 Sales group Sales office The sales office is the department of the company that is responsible for the sale of particular products through a particular distribution channel. As Figure 4.13 shows, several sales areas can be allocated to a sales office. A sales area can be used by several sales offices. As the sales office is allocated to the sales area, it is therefore also allocated to the sales organization. The sales organization is in its turn allocated to the company code, so that the results can be automatically entered into the financial modules.

Figure 4.13 Sales office

Example 4.11 In the northern Netherlands there are two sales offices – one for sales through the route run and one for the express run. It would also have been possible to subdivide the sales offices into the various product groups or sorts of clients.

Sales group This category makes it possible to group together the sales assistants who are involved in the same sales activities. A sales group can perform sales activities for several sales offices. Several sales groups can be operative in one sales office. These sales groups make it possible for various accountability areas to be defined within the sales office.

Figure 4.14 Sales group

Example 4.12 Northern Netherlands has three sales groups: route run, express run and representatives. The route run and the express run groups receive all the orders. The representatives visit the most important clients to maintain contacts and to take orders. They can take orders for both the route run and the express run and they are therefore assigned to both sales offices. The route run and express run are only assigned to one sales office (route run office and express run office respectively).

4.6.3	DISTRIBUTION

This paragraph describes basic elements of shipment processing organization. This includes: •	 Shipping point •	 Loading point Shipping point From the shipping point the goods are sent to the customer. This location can be physical (e.g. a collection of loading bays at the storage location), but it is also possible to define a group of employees as a shipping point (a group of employees who are responsible for particular shipping activities). A shipping point can service several plants, while plants can also make use of several shipping points.

Example 4.13 As mentioned earlier, the wholesaler has set up three plants (=three logistical flows) in SAP, with a corresponding storage location. Three shipping points have also been set up – Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven.

Loading points The SD module can also be used if no loading points have been established. If use is to be made of the extensive possibilities relating to stock registration, delivery loading points should be established. As Figure 4.16 shows, a loading point can only be allocated to one shipping point.

Customizing

5	 CUSTOMIZING
Customizing in SAP means the adaptation of the system to meet the wishes and requirements of the organization which is to use SAP. The adaptation is accomplished by means of setting up an enormous number of control parameters, which in turn determine how SAP responds to specific actions. SAP implementation has the effect of bringing about major changes in the majority of operational processes and in the work procedures used by the majority of the organization’s employees. A good deal of consideration and attention has to be given to these issues. In most cases, a special project will be initiated to serve the purposes of the implementation, drawing on the services of external consultants who are able to supply (additional) operational know-how and knowledge of SAP. In this chapter customizing is mentioned.

5.1	 SCOPE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION
The scope of the project, i.e. the range of operational processes initially to be covered by SAP, determines the focus of attention of this implementation project. It is often impossible to make immediate use of all the SAP modules that would be of benefit to the organization, for the following reasons: 1.	 The project would either take too long as a result, or the number of people working on the project would become so large that the management of the project would be jeopardized. 2.	 The impact on the organization caused by the implementation would be so extensive that there would be a major likelihood that the system would meet resistance and not be accepted. 3.	 Another problem would be that employees responsible for the maintenance of the system would lack the knowledge needed to carry out their tasks owing to the sheer complexity of the implementation. An option frequently adopted is to implement only the financial modules or only the logistics modules, as a first step.

Customizing

It is vitally important that the scope of the implementation (defined at the start of the project) is properly monitored. Proposals for improvement, which will almost certainly arise from within the organization during the project, are likely to be phrased in terms like ‘Now that you are already working on…’, ‘Wouldn’t it be a good idea to…’, etc. If attention is paid to these proposals, both the project’s duration and the budget for the project will be under threat.

5.2	 THE APPROACH TO THE PROJECT
In an extensive project like the first time implementation of SAP, it is vital that an approach/method should be selected which will provide sound direction for the project as a whole. A standard software development methodology could be used for the purpose, for instance, though a number of the activities, mainly in the functional and technical system development phases, will be superfluous in the implementation of a standard package. It is more worthwhile to make use of a specific RAD (Rapid Application Development) method, since these methods are more suited to prototyping, evaluate the design with a working system. SAP also offers its own implementation method, i.e. the Procedure Model. This method is supported by the customizing module from version 3 and onwards. The ‘implementation partners’ also frequently make use of this method. These are the companies that assist with the implementation (e.g. Magnus, Inter Access). Figure 5.1 shows the Procedure Model. Each phase is divided into a number of ‘Working Packages’, which are then subdivided into activities.

5.3	 CONFUSING TERMINOLOGY
There may be some confusion with regard to the difference between Business Process Reengineering (sometimes referred to as Business Process Redesign), on the one hand, and Business Engineering on the other hand. Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) is the (partial) redesign of existing operational processes, including the automation of these existing operational processes. Business Engineering (BE) is the development of radical, new and integral process-orientated operational solutions supported by information technology. BE therefore goes further than BPR. A number of synonyms are used. This is a tiresome feature from one perspective, though it is a situation you often encounter in practice. Here is a brief survey of terms, which is intended to avoid confusion. The authors mean the same thing when they use the following concepts: •	 Reference model •	 Business Blueprint

5.4	 ACCELERATED SAP
An implementation tool has been developed by SAP in order to shorten the implementation time and thereby reduce the costs of the implementation path. This is on the market under the name ASAP and covers the full path from project preparation up to and including the introduction of SAP (going LIVE). ASAP consists of a roadmap of the implementation work and the associated planning. Five phases are identified by the roadmap: 1.	 Project Preparation: the initial planning and preparation of the project. 2.	 Business Blueprint: the definition of the operational processes. 3.	 Realization: implementation on the basis of the Business Blueprints. 4.	 Final Preparation: the testing of the system and the training of end users. 5.	 Go Live & Support: the definitive introduction. The roadmap incorporates things like input documents, questionnaires, checklists and illustrations. Output documents are generated as a result; these include the Business Blueprint for the SAP processes to be initiated. Implementation quality control is also carried out under ASAP.

5.5	 CUSTOMIZING
Adaptation or customizing of SAP is not forbidden, but changes to settings can have farreaching consequences. We kindly but emphatically request you to be very careful with regard to any small adaptations you may make to the system. If in any doubt, please ask the system administrator for permission first. You are not permitted to make any changes to cross-client settings! You can do almost anything with the system, so deal prudently with this responsibility. Every action you take is recorded, which means it is always possible to find out who entered specific data or made specific changes! Customizing is carried out using the Implementation Guide (IMG). This contains both texts and illustrations on customizing and lists the customizing options available. You will find the IMG with: SAP menu →Tools →Customizing →IMG → Project Management The ‘SAP Reference IMG’ button brings the guide into view. A indicates that there are sub-chapters.

SAP Product Lifecycle Management Product innovation brings new challenges daily – environmental concerns, shorter product life spans, globally distributed sites and project teams. Today manufacturers must deliver high-quality products quickly and cost-effectively – while retaining and building a customer base, reducing service costs, and complying with international regulations. After using sophisticated systems for design, enterprise resource planning, and customer relationship management, you may still need to get new products to market faster. Critical departments and functions may still operate separately. Suppliers and partners may have challenges getting through your firewalls. You need an integrated product lifecycle management (PLM) software solution for collaborative engineering, product development, and management of projects, product structures, documents, and quality. That PLM software should provide an information backbone to help you access relevant information anywhere, anytime. You need the SAP Product Lifecycle Management (SAP PLM) application. The SAP PLM application provides integrated product lifecycle management software. PLM offers a single source of all product-related information needed for collaborating with business partners. PLM supports processes including product innovation, design and engineering, quality and maintenance management, and control of environmental issues. SAP Supplier Relationship Management Faced with the business demand for sustained profitability, companies of all sizes are looking to sourcing and procurement – and the bottom-line advantage of managing supplier spend. If you can reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, you can boost profitability – without increasing sales or sacrificing quality. With the SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SAP SRM) application, you can simplify and automate procurement. The SAP SRM application integrates strategic practices for supplier qualification, negotiation, and contract management more tightly and cost-effectively with other enterprise functions and their suppliers’ processes – through a single analytical framework and support for multichannel supplier enablement.

The SAP SRM application is designed as a long-term foundation to secure the cost and quality advantages of center-led purchasing and broadened supplier involvement for enduring value and long-term results. If you are seeking a low-risk way to prove the value of e-sourcing before investing in the SAP SRM application, you can use a hosted version of the SRM sourcing software for a temporary period. With SAP SRM, you get a supplier relationship management software application designed to achieve sustainable savings, value-generating supplier relationships, and faster business innovation. SAP Supply Chain Management SAP SCM: Software for collaboration, planning, execution, and coordination across the adaptive supply chain network. In an age of intense competition, supply chain efficiency and adaptability are not just requirements for success. They are necessities for survival. The SAP Supply Chain Management (SAP SCM) application is software that can help your organization transform a linear supply chain into an adaptive supply chain network, in which communities of customer-centric, demand-driven companies share knowledge, intelligently adapt to changing market conditions, and proactively respond to shorter, lesspredictable life cycles. Many companies across the globe have used the SAP SCM application to improve their business and operations processes. In fact, the SAP SCM application is the only supply chain software application that integrates collaboration, planning, execution, and coordination of the entire supply chain network – an application empowering you to: •	 Synchronize supply to demand – Balance push and pull network planning processes. Replenish inventory and execute production based on actual demand. •	 Sense and respond with an adaptive supply chain network – Drive distribution, transportation, and logistics processes that are integrated with real-time planning processes. •	 Provide network-wide visibility, collaboration, and analytics – Monitor and analyze your extended supply chain.

6.3	 SAP PORTAL
The SAP Portal, formerly called Workplace, is a web-based environment in which the information and the tools are readily available. The idea behind this, however, is that staff will do their work better and more quickly because everything is available from every location with a mouse click. In many companies, you see the network desktop as the center of events: the use of a (Microsoft) Office environment as the suite of PC applications makes it possible to work with digital documents and particularly to exchange them. Once employees are used to the same graphic user interface, it becomes a lot easier to work with. The next step is what are known as portals, a structured manner to present information on the Internet. Portals on the Internet are as it were the input ports for all sorts of information. SAP has also contributed to these developments with SAP Portal. The Portal relates to the entire work environment of an employee, not only the documents lying on his desk, but for example also the tasks that the employee has to carry out, and it also gives access to the information that the employee needs. Furthermore, there are links to the IT systems to which the employee has access. SAP expresses it as follows: a user’s gateway to the IT systems that he or she requires to do a designated job.

C-Business means collaboration between suppliers and customers as a result of which suppliers and customers appear to be working in one company. This functionality should result in an optimal value chain. Collaborative Business Maps (C-Business Maps) give a blueprint of how the SAP E-Business platform could be set in for various industries. SAP uses these diagrams to depict the communication with the outside (suppliers and customers). In this book you use C-Business diagrams for processes and to focus on the collaboration between the departments within a company.

IDES

7	IDES
IDES, the ‘Internet Demonstration and Evaluation System’ or ‘International Demonstration and Education System’ in the SAP systems, represents a model company. It consists of an international group of companies with subsidiaries in several countries. IDES contains application data for various business scenarios that can be run in a SAP System. The business processes in the IDES system are designed to reflect real-life business requirements, and have access to many realistic characteristics. In this chapter, the structure of the IDES database will be described in brief.

7.1	 SHORT DESCRIPTION OF IDES
IDES uses easy-to-follow business scenarios to show you the comprehensive functions of the SAP systems. The focal point of IDES, however, is not the functionality itself, but the business processes and their integration. These IDES business processes are described in detail within this online documentation. The individual demos provide you with an overview of the master data, and contain stepby-step instructions on how to execute the individual processes. IDES covers not only the Logistics area, but also Financial and Human Resources. It demonstrates how the SAP ERP System is able to support practically all types of industries, from discrete production through to process industries, from engineering-to-order to repetitive manufacturing. However, IDES is not a sector-oriented model company. The individual processes are based on practice-oriented data for sectors such as Retailing or Banking. The IDES group manufactures products as diverse as elevators, motorcycles, and paints. IDES is managed by SAP just as any regular business enterprise. SAP regularly updates the IDES data (master data, transaction data, and customizing). You also carry out period-end closing and plan with different time horizons. Transaction data are generated to ensure that the information systems in all areas have access to realistic evaluation data. You are constantly implementing new, interesting business scenarios to highlight the very latest functions available in the SAP systems. New functions are represented and documented by IDES scenarios.

IDES

Above all, IDES shows you the possibilities of the integrated applications in the SAP System. You cover all aspects of a business enterprise, including Human Resources, Financial Accounting, Product Cost Planning, Overhead Management, Profitability Analysis, Planning, Sales and Distribution, Materials Management, Production, and much, much more. You also have integrated document administration and third-party CAD systems within the IDES system. This means that you can call up and display external documents, or access CAD drawings. IDES shows you how the SAP ERP System supports production processes, the supply chain, and the efficient usage of global resources. Or perhaps you would like to increase your understanding of just-in-time production or the integration of the electronic KANBAN system in an MRP II environment? IDES provides the ideal way to learn about areas such as Product Cost Controlling, Activity-Based Costing, or Integrated Service Management and Plant Maintenance. How to manage high inflation is just one of the ever-growing number of IDES business scenarios that you can choose from. The IDES group comprises four subgroups. These are the European subgroup, with a plant in Germany, the Netherlands and other countries, and the North America group, the Latin America group and Asia. Each of these companies has its own clearly defined business objectives within the consolidated group and is organized according to local business practices and legal requirements. Consolidation takes place across the financial areas. For example, the French subsidiary operates solely as a sales company, whereas in Mexico, you demonstrate high-inflation methods and the material ledger. The American and German subsidiaries produce goods, as well as carrying out purchasing and sales activities. Accounting and Human Resources for each individual company have been adapted to meet the particular business objectives. Germany and the United States, for example, have been set up to use flexible standard costing, whereas the United Kingdom uses static standard costing based on full costs.

7.2	 STRUCTURE OF IDES SALES ORGANIZATION
IDES has two sales organizations in Germany: 1000 and 1018. The products and services marketed are clearly allocated to one division and reach the customer via different distribution channels.

10	GENERAL LEDGER ADMINISTRATION
In this chapter a general ledger account is created, and a balance sheet and profit and loss statement are generated for the IDES company in Germany.

10.1	 GENERAL LEDGER ACCOUNT MASTER DATA
A Chart of Accounts consists of all ledger account numbers. A particular subsidiary company activates a selection of ledger accounts from the Chart of Accounts using its own company code. A Chart of Accounts is generally established for all subsidiary companies on a countryby-country basis. The financial administrator has established that no account for special advisory costs exists in the Chart of Accounts, so that this account needs to be created. The account does not yet exist in the INT Chart of Accounts (Chart of Accounts – international), nor has it been created for the company concerned. You will therefore create account number 417???.

13	 LOGISTIC MASTER DATA
To enable a complete ERP process: from purchasing, inventory, and production to sales, the master data for the materials, the master data for the production (bill of material, direct wage hours and machine hours, work center and routing) and the purchasing (info record) are to be created.

13.1	 MASTER DATA FOR THE MATERIALS
The bicycle will be created as a finished product. The views you will create will determine the characteristics of a material for sales, planning (MRP), inventory and accounting. The components, frame and wheels, are created as raw materials. Within SAP ERP it is possible to manage the inventory with or without warehouse management. To illustrate this, the bicycles are only managed at the inventory level. The warehouse management is activated for the frame and the wheels by entering the views of warehouse management.
13.1.1	SPECIAL BICYCLE

Go to the screen for setting up a material, a special bicycle, using the following menu: SAP menu → Logistics → Materials Management → Material Master → Material → Create (Special) → Finished Product The material (code) that needs to be entered is SB???. Once you are in the ‘Industry sector’ box, scroll to ‘Mechanical engineering’. Press «Select view(s)». Select the following views: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 Basic Data 1 Basic Data 2 Sales: Sales Org. Data 1 Sales: Sales Org.

An automatic check is made to make sure that all required fields have been filled in before you leave a view. All other fields then turn grey, i.e. they cannot be changed and the required field remains white. The required field must be filled before the material can be released. The purpose of this method is to prevent incomplete data for materials – meaning not all required fields are filled – being added to the material master. The ‘Basic data’ are data that are exclusively dependent on the material.

14	 COMPLETE ERP PROCESS
In this chapter you carry out a complete ERP process: from purchasing, inventory, and production to sales. The process is a sales-driven assembly production process planned by a MRP I run.

14.1	GENERAL
This process is using the master data that was created in previous chapters: the customer, the vendor, the employee, the materials and the other logistic master data. The process starts with a sales call with the customer. The customer is interested in five special bicycles. Because of the unpredictable demand for the bicycle it is not on stock. The bicycle is assembled and the frame and wheels are procured externally. The customer asks for a quotation for five bicycles. The customer accepts the quotation and the quotation can be transferred into a sales order. Logistic control department plan production and purchasing requirements with a MRP-run. Purchasing will convert the purchasing requirements into a purchase order and the frames and the wheels will be purchased, delivered into the warehouse and invoiced. The invoice will be paid. The planned production can start and the materials can be issued. When the production order is completed the finished product will be stored in the warehouse. The sales order can be delivered and invoiced. The customer pays the invoice.

In the material master I can not adjust the standard price. Use transactioncode MR21 (entry box left on top startscreen). If the entry box is not open, click in the arrow right left from the ‘green entry arrow’ to open it. Enter the material code and give enter. The current price is listed and can be changed.

13.1.2

No moving price has been enterd for master data of the frame. With material master change immediately it is not possible to change the price. This is so set. The moving price can be changed directly with transaction code MR21. The moving average price will be adjusted automaticaly when purchases are carried out. With the creation of activity types man hours and machine hours the wrong validity dates are entered in the field ‘valid from’. These dates cannot be changed. (i.g. November 26th 2015 into January 1st 2015) Solution: create the missing dates by creating the same activity for the missing period. Use accounting\controlling\cost center accounting\master data\activity types\individual processing\create and enter the activity type for the missing period. In this case 1-1-15 tot 25-11-15. Copy of the created quotation to the salesorder does not work. I can find the quotatins with the use of the search criteria “sold to party” 35???. The error message states that the quotation is incomplete and can not be copied for that reason. Solution: use SAP menu->Logistics -> Sales and Distribution -> Sales -> Quotation -> Change to change the quotation and then select from the pulldown menu: edit> incompletion log. Check what is incomplete. In case of missing logistic data enter first Plant ‘1000’ and carry out the incompletion log again to see if the quotation si complete.

At ‘Post goods issue’ I get the message “Delivery has not been completely processed by WM”. What is the problem? When you carry out the picking a transferorder is created. With ‘S&D-Sales-OrderDisplay’ and then choose <<Environment-Document Flow>> the transfer order is shown. Select the de transferorder and choose for << Display Document>>. The status of the document is that the transffer order is still active and the confirmation completion is open. Confirmation can be carryed out with SAP menu – Logistics – Logistics Execution – Internal Whse Processes – Stock Transfer – Confirm Transfer Order – Single Document – In One Step. Note that the bike is in the master data set up by accident linked to Warehouse Management.
