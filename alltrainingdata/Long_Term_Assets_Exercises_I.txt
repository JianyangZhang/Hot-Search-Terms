Problem 1: Solution

Solution
a)	 The investment should be accounted for as an “available-for-sale” investment. Management intent is crucial to this outcome. If the intent were to trade for a near-term profit, the investment would be accounted for as a trading security, and gains/losses would be part of “operating income” rather than “other comprehensive income. b)

Problem 4: Solution

Solution
a)	 The investment should be accounted for via the equity method. The equity method is used for investments where the investor has the ability to exert significant influence over the investee. The presumption is that the ability to exert significant influence occurs at investment levels generally at the 20% and above level (however, this presumption can be overcome and the equity can be used for investments at lower levels, and vice versa). Note that market value adjustments are generally not recorded for investments accounted for under the equity method. b)

c)	 In the absence of significant influence, the investment would initially be recorded at cost. Subsequent adjustments would be made based on changes in market value of the stock. The manner of recognizing these value changes would depend on whether the intent of the investment was “trading” or “available for sale.” In either case, the dividends would be recorded as dividend income.

Summer Fun Corporation acquired 30% of the stock of Island Adventures. Summer Fun’s investment is a long-term strategic investment. Summer Fun anticipates that its investment will permit it to elect certain board members and otherwise exercise influence over the plans and policies implemented by Island Adventures. Summer Fun paid $5,000,000 for its 30% interest. The acquisition occurred on January 1, 20X3. On that date, Island Adventures had total stockholders’ equity of $25,000,000. During 20X3, Island Adventures earned $6,000,000 and paid $1,000,000 in dividends. Both companies have December 31 year ends. a)	 Prepare Summer Fun’s entries to account for the activity pertaining to the investment in Island Adventures. b)	 Calculate the change in Island Adventure’s total equity during the year, and compare this to the change in Summer Fun’s Investment in Island Adventure’s account.

a)	
GENERAL JOURNAL Date 1-Jan Accounts Investment in Island Adventures Cash To record the purchase of 30% of the shares of Delta 31-Dec Investment in Island Adventures Investment Income To record share of Island Adventure's income (30% X $6,000,000) 31-Dec Cash Investment To record share of Island Adventure's dividends (30% X $1,000,000) 300,000 300,000 1,800,000 1,800,000 Debit 5,000,000 5,000,000 Credit

b)	 Island Adventure’s equity increased from $25,000,000 to $30,000,000 ($25,000,000 + $6,000,000 - $1,000,000). This $5,000,000 correlates with the $4,000,000 increase (30%) in the Investment in Island Adventure account on Coastal’s books ($5,000,000 beginning balance + $1,800,000 debit - $300,000 credit = $6,500,000 ending balance). This correlation between the equity of the investee and Investment account of the investor is expected, and help explains why the term “equity” method is used to describe the accounting approach.
