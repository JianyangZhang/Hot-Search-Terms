Problem 2
Anthony Moore recently formed an information technology services and consulting firm in England. He was very busy during the first month and has not yet had an opportunity to install his computerized accounting package. But, he did understand the need to keep track of all transactions as they occurred. Following is a manual journal that he maintained for transactions occurring during January. All amounts are in the British Pound. Anthony has requested that you prepare a ledger of the company’s accounts, and post these transactions to determine the balance of each account. He needs this data in order to begin the process of transitioning to his new computerized accounting system.

Problem 3
The CEO of newly formed TrueTarget printed a copy of the company’s general ledger prior to a recent plane flight. She settled into seat 5A next to where you were sitting. Once airborne, she removed the printed “GL” from her brief case and began examining the report. Unfortunately, she realized that her printer had run out of ink on the very last page. She is frustrated because she is not able to determine the company’s exact profitability to date, and is on her way to a shareholder meeting where she is to issue a report on the company’s progress. She happened to note that you were studying an accounting book, and asked if you might help her. Prepare a trial balance from the general ledger, determine the missing amount for salaries expense, and determine the company’s profit for its first month.

The total salaries expense is $99,000 – the amount necessary to bring the trial balance into balance. TrueTarget was profitable, because revenues ($243,000) exceeded expenses ($9,000 + $12,000 + $99,000 = $40,000).

Problem 5

The Accounts Receivable general ledger account balance of $94,818 is in agreement with the sum of the individual subsidiary accounts ($21,711 + $9,825 + $28,650 + $34,632 =$94,818). This is an important reconciliation that should occur on a regular basis. Modern computer systems, including data base driven processes, have greatly reduced the frustration of maintaining subsidiary accounts that synchronize with control accounts. c)	 Subsidiary ledgers provide detailed information about the transactions with specific customers, vendors, and so forth. They enable one to know exactly what comprises a general ledger account balance. This information is very useful for many purposes, including preparing monthly billing statements for specific customers. Subsidiary ledgers might also be maintained for accounts payable, cash (if multiple bank accounts are in use), property assets (to track individual items of equipment in use by the business), capital stock (to track ownership of individual shareholders), and the like. d)	 Customer #2 is delinquent. This customer owed $15,825 at the beginning of May, but only paid $12,825 during the month. A portion of the beginning balance has been outstanding for more than the agreed 30-day period. Customer #4’s balance exceeds the $30,000 credit limit.

Problem 8

Problem 8
Mont Blanc Corporation is a small business operating in a state where a tax on income is contrary to the state’s constitution. In an effort to raise revenue, the state has imposed a tax on business receipts for services provided to customers (total revenues, whether collected during the period or not). The tax is equal to 1% of revenues in excess of $300,000. Mont Blanc prepared its state tax return by adding up the total deposits to the company’s bank account during the year. Total deposits were $1,240,000, and the company paid taxes of $9,400 (($1,240,000 – $300,000) × 1%). Assume you are an auditor for the state, and Mont Blanc has been randomly selected for a routine review. You immediately find that the company does not maintain a typical journal/ledger system, and is fundamentally clueless about proper accounting procedures. You have discovered the following limited information as part of your examination: Fact 1		 Fact 2		 Total deposits included $450,000 that resulted from issuing shares to stockholders. The total deposits included $75,000 of interest income on investments. The bank subsequently discovered the error, and removed the funds from Moncrief ’s account. Fact 4		 Mont Blanc provides some services for cash, and portions of that money are never deposited to a bank. The company maintains a cash receipts book and you have determined that $74,100 was collected from customers but never deposited. Fact 5		 Bank deposits during the period included a $3,600 refund check from a vendor relating to an overpayment for supplies. Fact 6		 The company deposits included $42,000 that was the result of a refund of an overpayment of federal income taxes. Fact 7		 During the year, Mont Blanc collected a customer deposit toward a future contract. This $30,000 advance was deposited and subsequently refunded when both parties mutually agreed to cancel the contract. Fact 8		Mont Blanc has many customers for which services are provided on account. As of the beginning of the year, the balance due from customers was $390,000. By the end of the year, accounts receivable had grown to $1,170,000. Mont Blanc has never experienced a problem with non-payment, and all customers pay their accounts in full within 90 days of a transaction.

Fact 3		 The total deposits included $2,700 that was the result of a bank error.
