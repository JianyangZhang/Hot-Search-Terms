Problem 1

Problem 1
Best Electronics operates a retail electronics company. Examine the following items and prepare the current liability section of the company’s December 31, 20X8, balance sheet. The beginning of year accounts payable was $150,000. Purchases on trade accounts during the year were $975,000, and payments on account were $915,000. The company incurs substantial costs for electricity to run its stores and air conditioning systems. As of December 31, 20X8, it is estimated that $82,500 of electricity has been used, although the monthly billing for December has not yet been received. Best Electronics sells service plans for as low as $25 per month. However, it requires its customers to prepay in 6-month increments. As of the end of the year, $562,500 had been collected for 20X9 web hosting plans. Best Electronic’s service plans are subject to sales taxes, and Best collected $97,500 during the year. All of these amounts have been remitted to taxing authorities, with the exception of $7,500 that is due to be paid in January, 20X9. The company has total bank loans of $2,250,000. This debt bears interest at 6%, payable monthly. As of December 31, 20X8, all interest had been paid, with the exception of accrued interest for the last half of December. The company’s bank loans ($2,250,000) are all due on June 30, 20X9. However, Best Electronics has a firm lending agreement with the bank to renew and extend $1,500,000 of this amount on a 5-year basis. The company intends to exercise this renewal option, but is not yet sure about the final disposition of the remainder.

The note was due in 6 months and bears interest at 10% per annum. 01-Jul	 Borrowed cash of $45,000, giving a $50,000 one-year note.

Problem 7
ABC Corporation has 8 employees. Information about the October payroll follows:
Federal Income Tax Withheld $450 $638 $167 $1,200 $2,681 $360 $400 $3,000 Name Ahn, M. Bhushan, F. Child, G. Edwards, J. Hall, J. Wong, I. Wu, C. ZoBell, D. Hours Worked 190 n/a 60 n/a n/a 150 148 n/a Pay Rate $12 per hour $2,500 per month $13 per hour $6,700 per month $10,200 per month $11 per hour $12 per hour $12,200 per month

Additional information is as follows: ABC is in a state without an income tax. Employees’ federal income tax withholdings depend on various factors, and the amounts are as indicated in the above table. No employees worked overtime, with the exception of Meeyeon Wong, who worked 30 hours of overtime. Overtime is paid at 150% of the normal hourly rate. Assume that gross pay is subject to social security taxes at a 6.5% rate, on an annual base of $100,000. Assume that Medicare/Medicaid taxes are 1.5% of gross earnings. These taxes are matched by the employer. Only James Hall had earned more than $90,000 during the months leading up to October. He had earned $91,800 during that time period. ABC has 100% participation in a $15 per month employee charitable contribution program. These contributions are withheld from monthly pay. ABC pays for workers’ compensation insurance at a 2% of gross pay rate. None of this cost is paid by the employee. ABC provides employees with a group health care plan, however the cost is fully paid by employees. The rate is $300 per month, per employee. ABC’s payroll is subject to federal (0.5%) and state (1.5%) unemployment taxes on each employee’s gross pay, up to $8,000 per year. All employees had earned in excess of $8,000 in the months leading up to October, with the exception of Francis Bhushan. Francis was first employed during the month of October.
