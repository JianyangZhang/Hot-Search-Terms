Problem 1

Problem 1
Providence City acquired its power plant from a private company on June 1. No receivables were acquired with the purchase. Therefore, total accounts receivable on June 1 had a zero balance. Providence plans to bill customers in the month following the month of sale, and 80% of the resulting billings will be collected during the billing month. 90% of the remaining balance should be collectable in the next following month. The remaining uncollectible amounts will relate to citizens who have moved away. Such amounts are never expected to be collected and will be written off. Electricity sales during June are estimated at $4,500,000, and expected to increase 25% in July. August sales will be 5% less than July sales. a)	 For each dollar of sales, now much is expected to be collected? b)	 Estimate the monthly cash collections for June, July, August, and September. c)	 As of the end of August, how much will be the estimated amount of receivables for which future cash flows are anticipated?

Problem 3
Prepare a direct materials purchasing plan for January, February, and March, based on the following facts. Global GPS Systems assembles its GPS systems with the following costs. Each GPS requires one computer system and four bateries. Computer Systems cost $140 each, and batteries are $2.50 each. Global is able to reliably obtain computers as needed, and does not maintain them in inventory. However, bateries are stocked in inventory sufficient to produce 20% of the following month’s expected production. Planned production is as follows: January	24,000 February	39,750 March	23,850 April	25,000 In accordance with the stocking plan, January’s beginning inventory included 20,000 batteries.

Problem 4

Problem 4
Clinton Summerhayes is CFO for a newly formed golf club manufacturing company. Below is the anticipated monthly production for the first year of operation, and beyond. Clinton is interested in learning which of the first twelve months will require cash outlays of more than $25,000 toward the purchase of composite shafts. Each unit requires 4 board feet of composite material at $15.70 per board foot. All composite material is purchased in the month prior to its expected use. Composite shaft purchases are paid for 15% in the month of purchase, 80% in the month following the month of purchase, and 5% in the second month following the month of purchase.

Which months will require cash outlays in excess of the $25,000 amount? Does the production in any given month necessarily correspond to the cash flow for that same month? What are the business implications of your observation?

Problem 5
Scott Logan Equipment produces exercise equipment. The following schedule reveals anticipated monthly production of bicycles for the first three months of the year: January	9,500 February	10,000 March	11,000 Scott budgets for 1.5 direct labor hours per bicycle, at an average cost of $18.00 per hour. Variable factory overhead is applied at the rate of $7.75 per direct labor hour. Fixed overhead is expected to run $70,000 per month, which includes $9,000 per month of noncash expenses related to depreciation. Determine the total expected monthly cash outflow for labor and overhead.

Problem 6
The chief financial officer for Backyard Playground products had previously established a line of credit with a local bank that enables Backyard to borrow 60% of the company’s inventory balance. The company currently has 2,000 units in stock, and is performing “on budget.” The budget anticipated that direct labor cost would be $16.50 per hour, and factory overhead is applied to production based on $9.20 per direct labor hour. Each unit requires 4.5 labor hours and 700 pounds of direct material. The direct material costs $0.15 per pound. Determine the amount of credit available under the borrowing agreement.

Problem 7
Review the following SG&A budget that was prepared at the beginning of the current year. The economy appears to be slowing, and sales are now expected to run only 80% of plan. How much can now be expected to result for total SG&A? The only fixed cost that can be reduced relates to the advertising campaign. What are the possible impacts of attempting to save money by cutting a portion of the advertising budget?

Reducing advertising would be a “tricky” decision. While it will immediately reduce costs, it might also impact sales and corporate brand value.

Scott Logan Equipment’s board of directors was presented with the following information about operations for an upcoming three-month period. The board desires to declare a dividend at the end of June, but still maintain cash on hand of $150,000. Scott began April with $175,000 of cash on hand. Prepare a cash budget, and determine how much cash will be available for the dividend? Is there any apparent risk associated with the dividend plan?

Solution 8
As the following cash budget reveals, $412,600 will be available for a cash dividend at the end of June (the amount by which ending estimated cash exceeds $150,000). The danger associated with this plan is that the $600,000 equipment purchase must be paid for in July. Paying the dividend will leave the company significantly constrained and potentially unable to make the requisite equipment payment.
