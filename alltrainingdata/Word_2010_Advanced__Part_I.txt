Introduction

Introduction
Word 2010 is a powerful word processing application that allows users to produce typed documents. These can range from simple letters through to fax cover sheets, reference manuals and sophisticated reports incorporating numbered headings, figures and graphics. All graphics related to Microsoft in this book is in compliance with Microsoft guidelines and thus permitted by Microsoft.

How To Use This Guide
This manual should be used as a point of reference following attendance of the introductory level Word 2010 training course. It covers all the topics taught and aims to act as a support aid for any tasks carried out by the user after the course. The manual is divided into sections, each section covering an aspect of the introductory course. The table of contents lists the page numbers of each section and the table of figures indicates the pages containing tables and diagrams.

Instructions
Those who have already used a spreadsheet before may not need to read explanations on what each command does, but would rather skip straight to the instructions to find out how to do it. Look out for the arrow icon which precedes a list of instructions.

Appendices
The Appendices list the Ribbons mentioned within the manual with a breakdown of their functions and tables of shortcut keys. Keyboard Keys are referred to throughout the manual in the following way: ENTER ‚Äì Denotes the return or enter key, DELETE ‚Äì denotes the Delete key and so on. Where a command requires two keys to be pressed, the manual displays this as follows: CTRL P ‚Äì this means press the letter ‚Äúp‚Äù while holding down the Control key.

”π”π Commands
When a command is referred to in the manual, the following distinctions have been made: When Ribbon commands are referred to, the manual will refer you to the Ribbon ‚Äì E.g. ‚ÄúChoose home from the Ribbons and then B for bold‚Äù.

Advanced tables

Moving and copying
Rows and columns in a table can be moved using the same procedures as text within a document. However, the position of the insertion point when pasting or dragging rows and columns is important as it can alter the final result.

Using Cut/Copy & Paste

”π”π To move or copy a row/column:
Mouse

1.	 Select the row to be moved/copied or select the column to be moved/copied. 2.	 Click on the Cut/Copy button. 3.	 Select the row where you want to paste (Word pastes above) or select the column where you want to paste (Word pastes to the left).

4.	 Click on the Paste button

Using Drag & Drop
Rows and Columns can also be moved or copied using standard drag and drop techniques.

”π”π To Move the selection:
Mouse 1.	 Click on the middle of the selected area and drag it to the new location

”π”π To Copy the selection:
Mouse 1.	 Click on the middle of the selected area and hold down the CTRL while you drag the selection to where you want to copy it. Release the mouse button before the CTRL key

Splitting A Table
Sometimes you need to split a table between rows to add text in-between.

”π”π To split a table in two at the current cursor position:
Mouse 1.	 Select the table at the point you wish to split it. 2.	 Go to the merge group on the layout ribbon and click the split Table button. Or Keyboard 1.	 Press CTRL SHIFT ENTER ‚Ä¢	 To rejoin tables that have been split, simply delete the paragraph marker between them.

Merging And Splitting Cells
When you have inserted your table there may be times in a number of cells that you would want them as one cell and not several and similarly you may wish for one cell to be split into several. In 2010 this feature is easy to do. Not only can you split cells but you can split a whole table into multiple tables if the need arises

”π”π To split cells
Mouse 1.	 Select the cell(s) you wish to split 2.	 Go to the merge group on the layout ribbon and click the split cells button.

”π”π To merge cells
Mouse 1.	 Select the cells you wish to merge. 2.	 Go to the merge group on the layout ribbon and click the merge cells button.

Mouse 1.	 Click in the row that you wish to be the first row of the split table. 2.	 Go to the merge group on the layout ribbon and click the split Table button. 3.	 The table will split above the row your cursor is in.

Table sizes and alignment
The columns, rows and positioning of a table on the page are all adaptable. Some of the techniques for getting the best results when changing these options are outlined below.

Advanced Column Width Techniques
When you adjust the width of a column, Word proportionately resizes the other columns to the right so that the overall table width does not change. However it is possible to be more precise about how the remaining columns should be affected. ‚Ä¢	 The SHIFT key allows the width of a column to be altered and increases the overall width of the table accordingly.

Column 1 width increases and so does the overall width of the table

Row Height

The height of the rows in a Word table is usually controlled by the contents of the cell. If the text in a cell is too wide, Word will wrap the text within the cell. Using the ENTER key to insert blank lines within a cell can also alter the height of rows. In a situation where a cell‚Äôs height needs to be set precisely there is an option on the layout ribbon that allows you to input a specific measurement. This is particularly useful if tables are being used to create forms and space should be left for people to fill the form in.

”π”π To change the row height:
Mouse 1.	 Select the rows where the height is to be changed 2.	 Choose Properties from the Layout ribbon

Option Exactly At Least Result This sets a specific height that will not adjust Enables specification of a minimum height, but will still fit rows around text that is taller

‚Ä¢	 You can also use the before and after options in the Paragraph format dialog box to space out text within cells in a table.

Table Alignment
Tables can be aligned to the left, right or centre of the page. The default for tables is left aligned. Individual rows can be aligned - but if the whole table is to be affected, ensure that the entire table is selected before issuing the command. ‚Ä¢	 This is NOT text alignment but TABLE alignment to the page

”π”π To change table alignment:
Mouse 1.	 Select the row(s) to align or the whole table. 2.	 Choose Properties from the Layout ribbon. 3.	 Click on the Table tab, and select the required alignment.

Indenting The Table
The whole table may be indented from the margin, this is useful to do if you wish to align your table with any indented text within a document

‚Ä¢	 The first row in the table will not be included in the sort, and the text in the cells of that row will appear as choices in the Sort by/Then by fields. No Header Row ‚Ä¢	 All the rows will be included in the sort, and you select the column number to sort by (rather than the names). The choice here depends on whether your table has headings in the first row:

Sort A Single Column In A Table

Table formulas
You can write formulae inside table cells to perform common calculations. You can use A1, B1-style references as you might in an Excel spreadsheet. However, you are not able to create relative cell references, therefore formulas cannot be copied across a row or down a column.

”π”π To create a formula:
Mouse

1.	 Position the mouse in the cell you wish to create a formula.

2.	 Under Table Tools, on the Layout ribbon, in the Data group, click formula. 3.	 Word may automatically suggest a formula, which you can overwrite. Use the = sign to begin the formula and the same mathematical operators as are used in Excel ( ,-,*,/).

4.	 Use A1 style references to cells within the table - you will have to work out which reference will apply to each cell you are referring to. In the example above, the profit has been worked out using the formula =B2B3, and assigning a currency number format to get the ¬£ sign. Formatting Numbers You can format a formula‚Äôs results by using the drop-down list of Number Formats in the formula dialog. The available formats are similar to those in Excel, such as Comma, Currency and Percentage.

Updating The Formula
If the figures in the table change, the formula result only updates when you print the document. If you want to see the new result on the screen, you will need to manually update the formula.

”π”π To update a formula‚Äôs result:
Keyboard 1.	 Click on the cell containing the result 2.	 Press F9. OR Mouse 1.	 Right click on the formula 2.	 Click on update field

Paste Function
When you use the paste function tool into a cell, Word will detect numbers in the cells above and to the left of the current cell and may offer to sum them for you. AutoSum Positioning at the bottom of a column of numbers automatically creates a =SUM(ABOVE) function. Positioning to the right of a row of numbers automatically creates a =SUM(LEFT) function. You can also use BELOW and RIGHT to refer to adjacent cells below or to the right of formulas. Functions You can paste in an Excel function, such as AVERAGE, COUNT or IF from a list contained in the Formula dialog.

Repeating Table Headings
When a table spreads across more than one page, it can be useful to automatically repeat the first row(s) of the table on each page as the first row(s) will often contain headings that apply to the columns of the table. If you choose to repeat table headings, the rows you have chosen will automatically be inserted at the top of each new page the table spreads onto. To edit the heading rows or make formatting changes, you must go back to the top of the table as it is simply an image of the first row(s) on the other table pages.

”π”π To repeat table headings:
Mouse 1.	 Select the row(s) that you wish to repeat at the top of each page that the table prints on. 2.	 Go to the data group on the layout ribbon and click the Repeat header rows button You will only see the repeating headings when you are in Print Layout or Print preview

Converting Table To Text
At times you may have data in a table that you wish was normal text to allow you to arrange it in other ways or do other things with it. So we need to remove the table from around the data and leave the data intact. Some form of delimiting character (separator) needs to replace the cell walls so that it can be turned back into a table if necessary at some later date.

Styles
In Word, a ‚Äústyle‚Äù is a collection of font and paragraph formats given a specific name. It may be used to apply formatting to areas of a document quickly or to make changes easily to everything, which already has a certain style applied. A style can either apply to a whole paragraph of text or to a few individual characters.

Default Styles
Word supplies a number of default styles, which are attached to the Normal Template. These may be altered to reflect personal choices. Normal Style The ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù style, in the Style list box (found by using the dialog box launcher of the styles group), controls the overall characteristics of most of the text in a document and is the style that will be first seen on opening a new document. Headings 1 - 9 Word supplies nine heading styles, which variously underline, bold, and indent etc. the text they are applied to. When a new document is created, based upon the Normal Template, only three heading styles appear to be available but you can see all the possible default styles changing which styles are viewed.(explained later)

It saves time if the style you are going to create has many formatting changes to base it on a similar style to the one you are going to create as then you will not have to make quite so many formatting changes. Another important reason is that if the base style is modified by say changing the font it will then apply to all the styles based on it without you manually having to go and change them all. Style For Following Paragraph 1.	 Select the style that you want applying to the paragraph after you press return in your document the next paragraph will be formatted with the style you choose here. ‚Ä¢	 E.G.

In draft view, columns are displayed as one column continuing down the page. Each time there is a snap to a new column this is shown as a dotted line with column Break labelled on it. If you try to use the columns button in this view, Word will change you to print Layout view.

Sections
Dividing a document into sections allows you to apply different page set-up options in different pages of your document. ‚Ä¢	 E.G. you might want page 3 of your document in landscape because it contains a very wide table, but the rest of the document is a report that needs to be in portrait orientation. You may want different margin sizes in different parts of your document or page numbering restarting in different formats at different points. Columns use sections so that each section can be treated differently from the others. Word sometimes adds the section breaks to a document for you. especially when you change the format for a selection.

On the far left corner of the status bar there is an indicator that tells the user which page and in what section the insertion point is currently working. E.G.: Page 13 Section 3.

Section Breaks
There are three types of break that will be examined here.

In Print layout view, breaks are invisible unless you show/hide characters. This feature lets you see all the special characters that make formatting you have carried out, visible, other than text formatting. That is ‚Äì spaces, carriage returns and tabs as well as breaks. You will also see other little symbols to indicate such things as table cells. To see the characters, click on the show/hide characters button. On the Home ribbon, paragraph group. ‚Ä¢	 You can also switch to Draft view and see breaks without activating other commands but this view can be confusing, especially when working with columns. A page break is not a section break Continuous Section Breaks Use the continuous section break to effectively make a fresh start in your document. Whatever kinds of formatting and other items went before ‚Äì columns, fields entered, styles etc., a continuous break makes the section above it just that, a section. It also allows you to change the page set-up options for that section only without affecting the whole document.

Advanced formatting

Inserts a section break, breaks the page, and starts the new section on the next page. This feature can be used ‚Ä¢	 E.G. to insert different headers and footers in the new page section. Odd Page And Even Page Section Breaks Useful when your document is set up with double-sided printing and mirror margins, these section breaks allow you to determine whether the next page should be odd (print on the right-hand side of the double-page) or even (print on the left-hand side of the double-page). What Is Stored Within A Section? A section can have its own unique headers and footers, margins and page orientation. It may also have a different number of snaking columns to the rest of the document.

Creating A Section Break
Sometimes Word automatically creates section breaks for you. ‚Ä¢	 E.G. when you make one of your pages landscape, or if you format some of the text to be displayed in a different number of columns. Otherwise, you have to create the section break manually. To create a section break: Mouse 1.	 Click on Breaks from the page setup group on the print layout ribbon

2.	 Select from the menu that appears. ‚Ä¢	 2010 gives a little explanation by the side of each option.

Choose Odd Page/Even Page to determine which side of the book the new section should begin on. The section break is displayed just before the new section: Word initially copies the header and footer, margin settings and page orientation into the new section. The margin and orientation settings can be easily changed from the Page Set-up dialog, since Word will assume you want to only affect the current section.

Document outlines
What Is A Document Outline?
An outlined document is one with a structure of headings, at various levels, with associated text. E.G. the chapter of this manual could be presented in outline.

When To Use Outlining
Outlining is most useful on larger documents or ones with a definable structure. An outlined document is easy to reorganise and restructure. Word also provides standard styles for the levels of an outline, which can be redefined for ease and speed of formatting. Tables of contents can be readily generated from outlines and the levels of the outline numbered in various ways.

Outlining A Document
Word provides a special view and nine heading level styles to create outlines. Outline view contains an outline bar to help quickly perform outlining tasks such as changing and displaying various heading levels. Existing documents can be outlined or a document outline can be created in a new document.

”π”π To create an outline in a new document:
Mouse 1.	 Create a new document using your preferred method. 2.	 Choose outline view from the status bar view buttons OR 1.	 Go to the view ribbon and select Outline from the document views Group. 2.	 Type a heading. Word automatically formats the text as heading level 1. 3.	 Press ENTER and then type the text for the next heading or body text paragraph. The new entry will have the same level as the previous entry. 4.	 To change the heading level, do one of the following:

To Define A New Multi Level List
If none of the multi level lists suit your purposes it is possible to define one of your own with many options all in one place to set the indents and number styles required for your document Level The Level field on the left of the dialog determines which Heading level Numbering you are modifying. To select a different level, either scroll up or down or click on the required level. Initially, Word always defaults to Level 1. Number Style The Number style: field controls the style of numbering, whether it is Arabic, Roman numerals, words or bullets. These styles are selected from the drop-down list. You can also specify what text (if any) should appear immediately before and after the number by adding it in the Number format field, and you can change the Font of the number. If you don‚Äôt want any numbering on a specific level, choose None from the Number style: drop-down. The Start at: field enables you to specify if the numbering should start at something other than one. Previous Level Number If you are creating a Legal or similar style, you can choose to make Levels 2-9 include the numbering of the previous level. E.G. if Level 1 style is 1, you can make Level 2 appear as 1.1. This option is not available for Level 1, as Level 1 has no previous level.

Master documents

A master document helps you organise and maintain a long document by dividing it into several subdocuments. With a master document, you can work either with the entire long document or with any individual subdocument. You can create a table of contents and an index in the master document, which refers to all the subdocuments, and you can build cross-references between two documents. You can work with a master document either in Master Document View or Draft View. If you want to work on the entire master document as if it were a single document, work in Draft View. Master Document View, however, is used to create, insert, open and reorganise subdocuments in the long document.

4.	 Move within the main document to create other subdocuments. 5.	 Save the master document as you would with any other document. All of the subdocuments will be saved in the same location as the master with default names. (First letter of master and subdocument number)

Creating A Master Document Outline
The outline is simply a list of the topics that your overall document is going to discuss. When you create the outline for the Long Document, you must use the standard Heading styles (Heading 1-9). It is a good idea to leave a couple of blank lines at the start of the outline, since this will leave space for a table of contents, and an overall document title.

Create the Subdocuments from the Outline
Each outlined topic together with its subtopics can be divided into a subdocument.

”π”π To create subdocuments using the master document outline:

Saving The Master Document
To save the master document and all of the subdocuments, save the Master Document as you would any other document. When you assign a filename and click on OK, Word automatically creates filenames for all the subdocuments. It uses the first character of the heading that begins each subdocument. E.G. if you have a subdocument that begins with ‚ÄúChapter 1‚Äù, the resulting filename will be ‚ÄúCHAPTERI.DOC‚Äù. If a subdocument filename is going to conflict with an existing file, then Word uses part of the heading text and appends a number for the filename, E.G. ‚ÄúCHAP1234.DOC‚Äù.

2 -Convert An Existing Document Into A Master Document
It may be advantageous in some situations to convert existing files to be used as master and sub documents.

”π”π To change a document into a master:
Mouse 1.	 In your existing document, switch to outline view and click on show document to access the the commands. 2.	 Use Outline view to promote and demote the heading styles as necessary 3.	 Then highlight the necessary text and create the subdocuments from the outline and save the master document. These two processes are covered in the previous section, ‚ÄúCreating a New Master Document‚Äù.

Add some space at the start of the document (press ENTER a couple of times) if you wish to leave room for other items. 3.	 Position the insertion point where you want to insert the first document 4.	 Click on the Insert Subdocument button and select the file from the Insert Subdocument dialog.

5.	 Repeat these last two steps for all the subdocuments. When you save the Master Document, all the subdocuments retain their original filenames and locations Avoid inserting a subdocument at the top of the Master Document. Try to leave a few blank lines, as this will make it easier to include a table of contents and a title page.

Opening A Subdocument
You can either open a subdocument from within the master document or as a completely separate file in the normal way.

”π”π To use the master to open a Subdocument:
Mouse 1.	 Open the master document and switch to outline view 2.	 Double-click on the subdocument icon belonging to the subdocument you want opened An advantage to opening a file this way, is that you don‚Äôt have to remember what the file is called or where it is saved.

Renaming A Subdocument
If you want to rename a subdocument or save it in a different location, you must open the subdocument from within the master.

Press DELETE This action deletes the subdocument from the main document but the subdocument would still exist on the drive and directory where it is stored with the same filename it had before.

Sharing A Master Document
One of the great advantages of using master and subdocument documents is that more than one person can be working on them at the same time. When you open a master document, you will be able to edit any of the subdocuments that belong to you - these would be the ones that you created. However, if someone else created one of the subdocuments you can only open it as read-only, unless you unlock it. Word determines which document belongs to which person by looking at the name of the Author in the Properties. A subdocument for which you are not the author will have a small padlock displayed under the subdocument icon. This means that the subdocument is locked for editing you can only open it as read-only.

Mouse 1.	 Open master document and switch to Outline view, click on the show document button. 2.	 Click somewhere in the subdocument 3.	 Click on the Lock/Unlock Document button. The padlock symbol should then disappear allowing you to work on the subdocument.

Multi-User Access
More than one person can work on the same master document at the same time, however they cannot work on the same subdocument. If you want to work on a subdocument, and let one of your colleagues work on one of the other subdocuments, you should do the following: So that you can work on a subdocument while someone else accesses the master document do the following. (this is assuming that all path names are not known to you. Otherwise it is a simple matter of closing the document someone else wishes to access.)

”π”π To allow others access to the master document:
Mouse 1.	 Open master document and switch to Outline view, click on the show document button. 2.	 Open the required subdocument (unlocking if necessary) 3.	 Using the view ribbon, switch windows command, switch to the master document. 4.	 Close the master document so that your colleague can open it 5.	 Your colleague can then follow the same process. He or she should also close the master document after opening the relevant subdocument so that you or another colleague can open it. Any changes made to the subdocuments will update in the master document.

Formatting A Master Document
You can format a master document just as you would any other Word document. Any formatting you apply when working in the master document will where relevant carry through to the subdocuments. E.G. if you redefine the formatting of one of the heading styles, the change will automatically carry through to the whole master document and its subdocuments. However, because subdocuments are placed in separate sections of the master document some changes you make may not be carried through to the whole document. E.G. if you make one of the subdocuments landscape, this will only affect the subdocument unless you specify in the Page Set-up dialog that it should affect the whole document.

Word 2010 Advanced: Part I Styles

Outlining / Master documents

The style definitions in the master document override the style definitions in a subdocument. If you insert a subdocument `with different style formatting, it will automatically adopt the master document‚Äôs styles. However when you open the subdocument, it will still retain the old formatting. Headers And Footers The Headers and Footers can be different in each subdocument, since they are in separate sections within the master document. If you want consistency throughout the master document, you should modify each of the subdocuments headers and footers to look the same. (Link to previous option on design ribbon when headers & footers are being edited: see sections) If you don‚Äôt set headers and footers for any of the subdocuments, the master document‚Äôs header and footer will automatically appear on every page. Tables Of Contents And Indexes You do not need to create subdocuments for a table of contents or an index in a master document, simply insert the table of contents as part of the master document before the first subdocument. Similarly insert the index typically after the last subdocument. Cross-References If you want to create a cross-reference between two subdocuments, make sure you have the master document open and are working in draft view. Printing The Master Document To print the entire master document print in the usual way. Printing A Subdocument To print one of the subdocuments, you can open it and print it as normal. If a subdocument contains cross-references to another subdocument, you must print the master document so that the cross-references are updated properly.

Templates
A template is a structure for a particular type of document. You can eliminate much of the work involved in creating new documents if you design templates for the documents you create most often. Templates can include text, styles, formatting, fields, macros, AutoText entries and graphics. The method of accessing templates is a little different in 2010

The new document area is split into 3 main areas ‚Ä¢	 Local templates created by you or preinstalled ones on your local machine these can be accessed any time they are stored in your user templates folder. ‚Ä¢	 Office.com templates you may see a thumbnail here if you have previously been online but you must be online to download and use these templates, ‚Ä¢	 The preview area far right to give you a preview of what your template will look like if you create a document based on this file

Create A Template
You can create a new template by modifying one of the templates supplied with Word, by saving an existing document in template format or by using the File Tab, New to set up a brand new template file.

”π”π To create a new template:
Mouse 1.	 Click the File Tab then New. The New document window will be to your right.

All template files are saved with a .dotx extension in the C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates. This location may be different if your company has specified a different location for user templates in the Options dialog. You can change the location in which to store your template, however, you may have difficulties accessing it

Template Settings
When designing a template for documents for a specific purpose, you should consider the usual appearance you want for the documents. Options that affect the appearance of a document include the following: ‚Ä¢	 Paper size ‚Ä¢	 Page orientation ‚Ä¢	 Margins ‚Ä¢	 Headers and footers ‚Ä¢	 Styles ‚Ä¢	 Themes

”π”π To set template appearance:
Mouse 1.	 Open the template file for editing as mentioned previously. 2.	 Access the Page set-up dialog and set the margins, orientation and paper size as appropriate. 3.	 Create any headers and footers within the template so that all new documents based on the template will have consistent headers and footers and Save the file.

Enhancing A Template
Any text or graphics that you save in the template will appear in every document based on that template. This is a way to create, ‚Ä¢	 E.G. a standard letter for your company that includes the company logo and address.

Customising The Template Environment
You can attach different features to a specific template. ‚Ä¢	 E.G. you can set up field entries and charts that are template specific and you can create macros that are only available to documents based on a particular template.

Fields
Fields are special codes that instruct Word to insert information into a document. They can be used to provide document information such as the file name, or the date when it was created. You can also use fields for simple information like page numbering and displaying the current date. Fields are also the underlying component of cross-references, tables of contents and indexes.

Weak passwords don‚Äôt mix these elements. Strong password: Y6dh!et5. Weak password: House27. Passwords should be 8 or more characters in length. A pass phrase that uses 14 or more characters is better. It is critical that you remember your password. If you forget your password, Microsoft cannot retrieve it. Store the passwords that you write down in a secure place away from the information that they help protect.
