Problem 1

Problem 1
Following are three separate transactions that pertain to prepaid items. Evaluate each item and prepare the journal entries that would be needed for the initial recording and subsequent end-of-20X3 adjusting entry. Assume the company uses the balance sheet approach, and the initial recording is to an asset account. The company has a calendar year-end and does not make any adjusting entries prior to December 31. 1)	 The company purchased an 18-month insurance policy for $9,000 on June 1, 20X3. 2)	  The company started 20X3 with $10,000 in supplies (this was previously recorded, and you do not need to make an entry for the beginning balance), purchased $15,000 in supplies during the year, and found only $6,500 in supplies on hand at the end of 20X3. 3)	  The company paid $1,200 to rent a truck. The rental period began on December 16, 20X3, and ends on February 14, 20X4.

Problem 4

Problem 4
Nathan Goldstien’s administrative assistant maintains a very simple computerized general ledger system. This system includes intuitive routines for recording receipts, payments, and sales on account. However, the system is not sufficiently robust to automate end-of-period adjustments. Below is the trial balance for the month ending January 31, 20X8. This trial balance has not been adjusted for the various items that are described on the following page. Review the trial balance and narratives, and prepare the necessary adjusting entries.
NATHAN CORPORATION Trial Balance January 31, 20X8 Debits Cash Accounts Receivable Prepaid Insurance Supplies Equipment Accumulated Depreciation Accounts Payable Unearned Revenue Loan Payable Capital Stock Retained Earnings, Jan. 1 Revenues Salary Expense Rent Expense Office Expense Dividends 	 $ 112,500 37,230 7,200 21,339 105,000 36,294 39,000 7,500 7,500 	 $ 373,563 	  $	 Credits 30,000 22,707 25,500 45,000 72,000 46,371 131,985 	 $ 373,563

Nathan Corporation’s equipment had an original life of 140 months, and the straight-line depreciation method is used. As of January 1, the equipment was 40 months old. The equipment will be worthless at the end of its useful life. As of the end of the month, Asher Corporation has provided services to customers for which the earnings process is complete. Formal billings are normally sent out on the first day of each month for the prior month’s work. January’s unbilled work is $75,000.

Utilities used during January, for which bills will soon be forthcoming from providers, are estimated at $4,500. A review of supplies on hand at the end of the month revealed items costing $10,500. The $7,200 balance in prepaid insurance was for a 6-month policy running from January 1 to June 30. The unearned revenue was collected in December of 20X7. 60% of that amount was actually earned in January, with the remainder to be earned in February. The loan accrues interest at 1% per month. No interest was paid in January.

Evaluate the following items, and determine the correct amount to report on the income statement for each, using the accrual basis of accounting for the referenced period of time.
Revenues A Company had beginning accounts receivable of $16,000. The company reported cash basis revenues of $200,000. The ending accounts receivable amounted to $36,000. B Company purchased $50,000 of supplies. Supplies on hand decreased by $10,000 during the period. C Company started the year with no prepaid rent, and ended the year with $2,000 in prepaid rent. Rent expense on a cash basis was $26,000. A the beginning of the year, D Company purchased and expensed an item of equipment for $40,000. The equipment has a 4-year life, and will be worthless after four years. There were no wages payable at the beginning of the year. E Company paid $290,000 in wages during the year, and owed an additional $24,000 at year’s end.

Solution 5
Revenues $220,000. The increase in Accounts Receivable corresponds to services rendered but not yet collected. Therefore, accrual basis revenues exceed cash basis revenues by $20,000. $60,000. The decrease in supplies means that $10,000 more was used than purchased. The accrual basis will measure supplies used as the amount of expense for the period. $24,000. The increase in Prepaid Rent signifies that payments exceeded consumption. $10,000. The accrual basis would result in depreciating 25% of the asset cost ($40,000/4 years). $314,000. Accrual basis Wage Expense would include the amount owed at the end of the year.

Problem 6

Problem 6
Toto Motors is an automobile service center offering a full range of repair services for high performance cars. The following information is pertinent to adjusting entries that are needed for Toto, as of March 31, 20X5. Toto has a fiscal year ending on March 31, and only records adjusting entries at year end. Toto has a large investment in repair equipment, and maintains detailed asset records. These records show that depreciation for fiscal “X5” is $61,700. As of March 31, 20X5, accrued interest on loans owed by Toto is $10,839. Auto dealerships outsource work to Toto. This work is done on account, and billed monthly. As of March 31, 20X5, $27,400 of unbilled services have been provided. Toto maintains a general business liability insurance policy. The prepaid annual premium is $12,000. The policy was purchased on October 1, 20X4. Another policy is a 6-month property and casualty policy, and it was obtained on December 1, 20X4, at a cost of $6,000. Both policies were initially recorded as prepaid insurance. The company prepared a detailed count of shop supplies at March 31, 20X4. $18,952 was on hand at that date. Management believed this level was greater than necessary and undertook a strategy to reduce these levels over the next year. During the fiscal year 20X5, Toto purchased an additional $62,500 of supplies, and debited the Supplies account. By March 31, 20X5, the effort to reduce inventory was successful, as the count revealed an ending balance of only $6,800. During the fiscal year, Toto began offering a service contract to retail customers entitling them regular tire rotations, car washing, and other routine maintenance items. Customers prepay for this service agreement, and Toto records the proceeds in the Unearned Revenue account. The service plan is a flat fee of $189, and Toto sold the plan to 678 customers. At March 31, 20X5, it is estimated that 25% of the necessary work has been provided under these agreements. Toto’s primary advertising is on billboards. Big and Wide Outdoor Advertising sold Toto a plan for multiple sign locations around the city. Because Toto agreed to prepay the full price of $13,000, Big and Wide agreed to leave the signs up for 13 months. Toto paid on June 1, 20X4, and recorded the full amount as a prepaid. However, the advertising campaign was not begun until July 1, 20X4. It will conclude on July 31, 20X5.

Examine each of the following fact scenarios, then prepare initial and end-of-year adjusting entries (when needed) assuming (a) use of a “balance sheet” approach versus (b) use of an “income statement” approach. You may assume a calendar year end for each scenario. Use T-accounts to show how the same financial statement results occur under either approach. The preprinted worksheet includes an illustrative solution for the first scenario. Scenario 1	 A $4,500, one-year insurance policy was purchased on June 1, 20X1. Scenario 2	 $60,000 of unearned revenue was collected on August 1, 20X1. 40% of this amount was earned by the end of the year. Scenario 3	 On December 1, 20X1, $9,000 was prepaid for space in a trade-show booth. The trade show is in February of 20X2. Scenario 4	 A $3,000 customer deposit for future services was received on April 1, 20X1. On June 20, 20X1, the customer canceled the agreement and received a full refund.

All of these events were booked in earlier months. During June, an additional 92 weddings were booked for future months. Final payments were received during June for 47 weddings performed in May. None of the June weddings resulted in receipt of the final payment before July 1, but full payment is expected.
