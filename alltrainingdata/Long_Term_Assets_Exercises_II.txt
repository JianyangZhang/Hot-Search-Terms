Problem 1

Problem 1
WasatchBank recently held an auction to dispose of various assets it had obtained through foreclosures and other loan settlements. Representatives of Aragon Semi Conductors attended the auction to bid on an abandoned manufacturing plant that WasatchBank included in the sale. The auction brochure listed the manufacturing plant as including all land, buildings, and equipment. The brochure indicated that an independent appraisal had been conducted and that land was separately valued at $3,500,000, the building at $7,000,000, and the equipment at $14,500,000. This information is believed to be reasonably accurate and fair. Aragon Semi Conductors wanted the site for a recycling business it planned to start at the location. All of the equipment would be used in this new operation. The minimum bid price was set at $16,250,000. As it turned out, the auction was poorly attended. Aragon was the only bidder on this property, and was fortunate to acquire the property at the opening bid minimum. Determine the correct cost allocation to the land, buildings, and equipment, and prepare a journal entry to reflect this acquisition.

Problem 3
On January 1, 20X5, Titanium Mines purchased a new mining excavator for one of its mines. The machine cost $1,250,000 and has a service life of 12,500 hours. Regulations require careful records of usage, and the machine must be replaced or rebuilt at the end of the 12,500 hour service period. Titanium simply chooses to sell its used machines and acquire new ones. Used machines are expected to be resold for 1/4 of their original cost. Titanium uses the units-of-output depreciation method. a)	 Assuming that the machine was used as follows, prepare a schedule showing annual depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and related calculations for each year. 20X5	 3,250 hours 20X6	 3,500 hours 20X7	 3,000 hours 20X8	 2,750 hours b)	 Show how the asset and related accumulated depreciation would appear on a balance sheet at December 31, 20X6.	 c)	 Prepare journal entries to record the assetâ€™s acquisition, annual depreciation for each year, and the assetâ€™s eventual sale for $312,500.

Problem 5
On January 1, 20X1, City Delivery purchased a delivery truck for $80,000. At the time of purchase, City Delivery anticipated that it would use the truck for 4 years, even though its physical life is 6 years. At the end of the 4-year period, City Delivery believes it will be able to sell the truck for $30,000. City Delivery uses the straight-line depreciation method. Gasoline prices increased significantly, and consumers began to buy more efficient vehicles. By early 20X4, it became apparent that the market for used delivery trucks like the one belonging to City Delivery was virtually nonexistent. Accordingly, City Delivery changed its plans and decided it would use the truck for its full 6-year life. At the end of the revised useful life, it is expected that the truck will be worth $3,500 for scrap value. Prepare a schedule showing annual depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and related calculations for each year.

Problem 6
On January 1, 20X1, The Daylight Bakery purchased a new mass production oven. The oven has an expected life of 6 years. The system cost $230,000. Shipping, installation, and set up was an additional $40,000. At the end of the useful life, Joey Dough, chief accountant for Daylight, expects to dispose of the oven for $54,000. He further anticipates total output of 2,400,000 loaves of bread over the useful life. a)	 Assuming use of the straight-line depreciation method, prepare a schedule showing annual depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and related calculations for each year. b)	 Assuming use of the units-of-output depreciation method, prepare a schedule showing annual depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and related calculations for each year. Actual output, in bottles, was 320,000 (20X1), 360,000 (20X2), 400,000 (20X3), 420,000 (20X4), 460,000 (20X5), and 440,000 (20X6). c)	 Assuming use of the double-declining balance depreciation method, prepare a schedule showing annual depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and related calculations for each year. d)	 Assuming use of the straight-line method, prepare revised depreciation calculations if the useful life estimate was revised at the beginning of 20X4, to anticipate a remaining useful life of 4 additional years (in other words, a total life of 7 years). The revised useful life was accompanied by a change in estimated salvage value to $27,000.

Problem 7
Thomas Jensen is conducting an audit of the property, plant, and equipment records of CyberLight Systems. Thomas selected two specific assets for closer inspection. Thomas has examined documentation related to each assetâ€™s original purchase and compared it to the recorded cost, physically inspected the item to determine that it is still in the possession of the company, and conducted other similar assurance procedures. The final step in the audit of these accounts is to test the calculations of depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation. Thomas has asked you to perform this final procedure for 20X8. Below is a schedule of the two assets, with the depreciation values determined by CyberLight. The building was depreciated by the straight-line method and the truck by the double-declining balance method. Determine if the indicated depreciation values are correct.

Problem 7

Solution
Both assets have depreciation errors. The correct values should be as follows: Building: Annual expense: ($2,400,000 â€“ $800,000) Ã· 25 years = $64,000 Accumulated depreciation: $64,000 Ã— 7.5 years = $480,000 Although the annual expense of CyberLight was correct, the accumulated depreciation appears to incorrectly reflect a full 8 years of depreciation ($64,000 Ã— 8 = $512,000). Truck: 20X6 expense: ($160,000 Ã— 25% rate Ã— 3/12) = $10,000 20X7 expense: (($160,000 â€“ $10,000 acc. depr.) Ã— 25% rate) = $37,500 20X8 expense: (($160,000 â€“ ($10,000 + $37,500) acc. depr.) Ã— 25% rate) = $28,125 Accumulated depreciation: $10,000 + $37,500 + $28,125 = $75,625 Multiplying the above correct values by (160,000-7,500)/160,000 arrives at the values reported by Cyberlight. Apparently, the company incorrectly subtracted the $7,500 salvage value in determining the base for depreciation. Recall that salvage value is initially ignored with this approach.
