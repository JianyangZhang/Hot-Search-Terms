HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Preface

PREFACE
Life is full of challenges and it is up to us to live these challenges, or suffer from them. Challenges was never meant to be impossible to those whom inspired the world. These type of people understood that life is a game and we have to overcome the challenges to play it safely and win. Inspiration have always been linked to challenges, failures and repetition. If we consider challenges as ignite to a mindset then inspiration would be an outcome to such condition. Then, if we apply such mindset practices to be utilised in socio-economy development we‚Äôll end up in using a sustainable source that never been deeply and comprehensively explored to the benefit of humanity. The world is in search more than ever today to a different economy concepts that makes sense. Most of us however been more of followers than creators of our fate, due to such materialistic driven economies that we rarely manage to engage with or control. In this book, we call for a transitional thinking and for an economy that is designed and built by all of us. This economy we call Inspiration Economy, it comes from within us to serve all of us, without the currency of the dollar, or the total dependency on external depleting sources. Inspiration Economy is therefore a concept that was developed to empower each one of us to see our legacy into our society and economy. If people, community and society understand and live the principles of inspiration economy our collective ability to create a stable and sustained developing world would be much more realisable. My claim about this book is that it is written not based on theoretical thoughts, but rather on a profound knowledge that was built over years of projects consultancy and life reflections. All the book works to deliver what is and how to create global and personal impact. The nine chapters are meant to address what is inspiration economy, then why inspiration economy is important and how to create such an inspiration based economy. I sincerely hope not only you enjoy reading the book, but become also a strong believer of it as a concept and way of life for the betterment of our life, as I did.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

1	 INTRODUCTION TO HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY
1.1	 BRIEF INTRODUCTION ABOUT INSPIRATION ECONOMY HANDBOOK
Life is not a play it is the most precious resource on earth. Life without spirit is also worth nothing. Spirit without inspiration is only an empty soul. However, an inspired soul gives life to all its surroundings for a long lasting time and with deep intensity. In this first ever reference handbook for what we coined as ‚ÄòInspiration Economy‚Äô (IE), we introduce for our readers 9 chapters that targets three main goals first the ‚ÄúDefinition & Essence of Inspiration Economy‚Äù, ‚ÄúSources of Inspiration Economy‚Äù, and the ‚ÄúPower of Inspiration Economy‚Äù. The handbook has more than 100 Case Studies and anecdotes relevant to the theme of the section and/or the chapters within that support the IE in practice and not only in theory. The reason behind a handbook on IE is the need to understand a combination economy involving not only a materialistic economy but also a self-driven and value based economy that is controlled by the human intrinsic powers which we call the ‚ÄúInspiration Economy‚Äù. Here there is a need for an economy that is based on revitalising the self through inspiration that can enable and then explore the natural resources besides the energy trapped within the inner self to be realised. The handbook relates findings regarding the purposes and means for an ‚Äòinspiration based economy‚Äô. It calls for contributions towards an inspiration economy that everyone can participate in with individuals as a source of inspiration followed by others through having hidden potential within the inner self. We believe this handbook is important since it addresses the issue of influencing change without power and even limited resources, and it is significant since it gives the power to influence. It calls for a practical shift in power to inspiring governments and non-profit organisations, where inspiration can be created and maintained. The handbook might be valuable also in helping to discover the principles and tools for overcoming many daily problems and it is a structured source that provides scientific based inspiration to face life‚Äôs challenges. It is a handbook about a holistic view where positive psychology works in harmony with socioeconomic needs and where humanities and sciences meet to develop a better world for current and future generations. In these terms there is an abundance of human knowledge, spirit and potential that needs to be tapped.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

Present day economies have moved from being industrial to information in the nineteen eighties and to knowledge based in the nineteen nineties. Today we have learning and innovation driven economies. Most developed and emerging economies are adopting practices leading to the enhancement of the knowledge based economy. Learning and innovation developments suggest we are moving towards learning and innovation economies. In parallel to this there is an emerging economy that is without territory and depends on discovering the potential of humans in the form of the inspiration economy. An inspiration economy is a mix of activities that lead to inspiration practices motivating the spirit of inspiration in socio-economic development. Mixed practices include entrepreneurship, innovation, risk taking, opportunity seeking/creating, and a focused and change driven mindset. It is an economy based on societies and organisations‚Äô abilities to discover potential and capacities of people and capitalize through inspiration. The handbook explores the constructs of an inspiration based economy and relevant challenges and practices.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

With regard to the organisation of the handbook there are nine chapters which include: chapter one ‚Äì introduction and rationale, chapter two demands for an inspiration economy, chapter three ‚Äì foundations and principles of an inspiration economy, chapter four ‚Äì economy psychology, chapter five ‚Äì inspiration economy enablers, chapter six ‚Äì tools and instruments of an inspiration economy, chapter seven ‚Äì characteristics and measures of an inspiration economy, chapter eight ‚Äì outcomes of an inspiration economy, and chapter nine ‚Äì inspiration economy future competing economies. We believe this is an exciting structure which provides considerable added value to an understanding of what an inspiration economy really is. Overall we believe this handbook presents an in depth analysis and understanding of what an inspiration economy should be. It portrays an inspiration economy as a mix of many processes that lead to inspiration practices that motivate an inspirational spirit for socio economic development. Such a mix takes the form of entrepreneurship, innovation, learning and a mindset that is change driven. It is an economy based on the abilities of individuals, organisations and societies. The target audience for the handbook is not limited to professionals or academics, or even policy makers, but extends to all those who want to discover the power within and how it can change their life journey or even their contribution to a better socio-economy stability and sustainability. A deep interest in not only understanding the mechanisms and workings of an inspiration economy, but also the tools and instruments that they can adopt and use to make reality of what they have learnt through reading and understanding the concepts described. It is this level of acquired understanding that has been the main driving force of the editors in compiling this handbook. We hope you enjoy reading the handbook of inspiration economy and integrate with us in developing this concept further towards better human experience and life journey.

1.2	 WHY A HANDBOOK ON INSPIRATION BASED ECONOMY?
After so many application of economy and socio-economy theories there are still many areas in the world living under sectarian conflicts, suffering from miserable poverty, or in no future security, or feeling controlled and always in need, going in circular conflicts, constrained by inequality or even different types of slavery. Many people come and go from life who have not experienced the value of self-realisation, self-worth, self-value and self-independence. This happens till date in different places, in different disciplines, in different countries, in different ages and in different cultures. One feels that our human civilisation, in spite of huge fast breakthroughs in technology; is going backward or saturated in its real human values development.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

Self-worth and the feeling of being totally independent and having a high competitive contribution to the world does not come always from materialistic economy theory, however it can come from a self-driven and value based economy. This simple combination economy we would like to call ‚ÄúInspiration Economy‚Äù. Today, we believe that there are more self-disabled people than those actually considered to be with physical or mental disabilities. Those people with self-disablement even doubted to be, unfortunately, are in the majority on the globe. Therefore, we have a huge niche for an economy that is mainly based on re-vitalising the self through inspiration. The world is in need of an economy that would enable the huge natural resources and energy trapped within the human inner selves to be realised. This handbook relates collections on milestones for finding different purposes and means for an ‚ÄòInspiration based Economy‚Äô, regardless of what capabilities or development we are in at this stage, what stage you wiill be in when we start the journey of inspiration. It is a handbook that calls for contributions towards an inspiration based economy that each one of us can participate in, starting from now. It is a handbook that says in the end, ‚Äúif you did not have the chance to have an inspiration, or not being lucky enough with the sources of inspiration around you, you yourself can be a source of inspiration for you and then for others, as you have lots of hidden potential within your inner self ‚Äù. Yes, we believe this handbook is important as there are today more people who are not happy, while they own a house and have a steady income, something that was a dream for many not more than 50 years ago. Yes, this handbook is important as it addresses the issue of influencing change without power and even with limited resources. Yes, this handbook is important as it gives the power to influence without having a power of position or money, fame, forces or followers. It is a handbook that calls for the practical shift of power from governments to inspiring governments and non-profit organisations, or even towards the new trend of the ‚Äòfor-giving‚Äô organisations, where inspiration would be created and maintained in a circular economy. This handbook is important since it gives principles and tools for overcoming many daily, periodical fear within us, about the instabilities around us, be it family based, society based, country based, regional based and/or globally based. It is a source of a structured and scientific based inspiration handbook about facing life challenges, overcoming fears of failures and learning from them while being more humble with repetitions.

Finally, it is a handbook about a holistic view created by both our right and left sides of the brain, where positive psychology works in harmony with socio-economical needs and where our humanities and sciences meet each other to develop a better world for us and for future generations.

1.3	 ECONOMIC SYSTEMS & INSPIRATION ECONOMY
Scarcity¬†is the fundamental challenge confronting all individuals and nations. How we deal with these economic limitations, how we prioritize and allocate our limited income, time, and resources. We are going back in a circle to the basic economic challenges and dilemmas that have been confronting nations and societies throughout history. It is really a shame in a knowledge based economy that we are still talking today about how we create potential out of human capital. In managing such failures many societies around the world have developed different types of broad economic approaches to manage their foreseen physical resources. In the meanwhile we are having only four recognized basic types of economic systems discussed, practiced and taught in most of economic and social studies and these are: traditional, command, market, and mixed economy, which all work on the concept and challenge of scarcity.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

In this Handbook we believe in the opposite. We believe the world is under a major challenge of not knowing how to deal with abundance. This is the abundance of human knowledge, human spirit, human potential, etc. While in scarcity based economies, economic decisions are made by individuals, in abundance based economies decisions are made by the spirit of the individuals. A¬†totally different approach to what is economy resources, powers, factors and measures is presented in this first edition of the Handbook of Inspiration Economy.

1.4	 WHAT IS INSPIRATION ECONOMY?
The economy has shifted so quickly, since the early ‚Äô80s of the last century, from being an Industrial Economy towards an Information Economy, then more quickly by the early ‚Äô90s towards being more of a Knowledge based economy. Today many scholars are talking about a Learning Economy and an Innovation driven Economy (Johnson, 2008; Antonelli, 2003; Lundvall, 1996). Even though many under-developed and developing world countries are still far behind in these concepts of economies; most of the developed, semi-developed and emerging economies are picking up practices that lead to the enhancement of the knowledge based economy. This can be clearly seen in the type of turnovers of publication activities, the development from infrastructure or growth scales in the international indicators towards more innovation scales. The scale of learning and innovation even suggests that we are going to move towards a Learning Economy or an Innovation Economy soon. However, close observation teaches us that parallel to this we are having an emerging economy that would move without territory and would depend on discovering the potential of human beings abilities. This economy can be called Inspiration Economy. The Inspiration Economy one could say is a mix of many things that lead to inspiration practices that motivate the spirit of inspiration in socio-economic development. These mixed practices can be like entrepreneurship, innovation, risk taking, opportunity seeking/creating; along with a focused and change driven mindset. It is a type of economy that would be based on our societies and organisations‚Äô abilities to discover the potential and the capacities or human being and thus capitalize on it through inspiration. In this book we will explore all the constructs of an inspiration based economy and the relevant challenges and practices.

1.5	 HISTORY OF INSPIRATION
Almost all of the great positive milestones of world history are linked to inspiration. Inspiration has been the source of major developments that have shaped world values, practices and achievements, whether through religions or different thinking and/or scholars or from many disciplines that flourished humanity with thoughts, inventions, projects and most of all their well to do. For inspiration the level of intensity, frequency, type and direction and time have been the main source of explanation and influence of why certain era or civilisation or certain countries are rich or more sustained, while others are poor or have demolished so fast. Inspiration is the simple explanation of why certain communities are vibrant and others are co-dependent on conditions and depleted resources. The level of Inspiration has been behind many historical achievements and failures. Even classical economists and most scholars, see variations in the level of inspiration and its sources as one of the main explanations of why certain civilisations have been ahead of others throughout history and till today. They see that through the sprit of inspiration more openness to trade occurs from government and society. Inspiration has been used in the description of creativity in artistic production, religious scriptures, the doctrine of different theologies, and sudden creativity, when a new¬†invention¬†is created. Through the spirit of inspiration macro-inventions occur that help radical change and openness for ideas from outside industry. History teaches us that with sustaining inspiration for micro-inventions the potential of macro-inventions become realized. Throughout history inspiration has pushed our human capacity and extracted our potential for a new learning that has unleashed the trajectory of improvements in the world.

1.6	 SYNOPSIS OF INSPIRATION LITERATURE
The literature on inspiration has been fragmented in several respects. First, inspiration has been studied as a religious, creative, or interpersonal phenomenon. Recent limited Inspiration research has been closely associated with positive psychology. To understand the inspiring influence of individuals, groups and societies, research today is trying to understand the inspiring sources that influence inspirational practices. Reviewing Inspiration in the literature shows that inspiration can be triggered by mainly extrinsic stimuli in the beginning or by intrinsic pauses of reflections relevant to experiences. Extrinsic inspiration as per the literature comes from a divine revelation, or a creative illumination, or from an inspiration source as creatures or nature or a phenomena.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

Inspiration whether caused by intrinsic or extrinsic factors is conceptualized as a trait and a state then it starts to infuse as an idea with a purpose into the mind, the heart and spirit at the same time. Inspiration here represents a collection of feelings that impact the type of behaviours exalted to transmit and/or actualize the beliefs and activities that create the originality of any contribution (Simpson & Weiner, 1989). Thrash and Elliot (2003) found that inspiration has a positive correlation with intrinsic motivation, open-mindedness and simplicity. Inspiration has been conceptualized as focused on transcendent stimulus qualities. Accordingly, we expected inspiration to be positively related to trait absorption (Tellegen, 1981), a readiness to enter psychological states involving engrossed attention to stimulus qualities such as beauty. Inspiration is found to depend on both experiential processing and rational processing. In experiential processing inspiration is linked with intuitive and concrete thinking, while in rational processing inspiration is expected to be triggered by trial and learning by doing, or even risk taking (Epstein, 1994).

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

In the leading inspiration work of Thrash and Elliot (2003) they expected that it would be related to experiential processing, given that inspiring stimuli tend to reach consciousness through experiential and perceptual processes (e.g., illumination). With inspiration Thrash and Elliot (2003) expected it to be positively related to rational processing and thus positively related to work-mastery, self-esteem, self-determination, inspiration frequency, inspiration intensity, besides social desirability. The literature shows that inspiration engages the head as well as the heart since the overall inspiration index shows it is correlated positively with absorption, consistent with our conceptualization of inspiration as focused on transcendent qualities of objects (Epstein, 1994). Inspiration correlated positively with work mastery, but negatively with competitiveness and fear of failure. Thus, inspiration converged with task-focused engagements and correlated positively with creativity, a capacity that has long been ascribed to inspiration rather than personal initiation. Inspiration in the literature serves as an influx of utilization of both motivation and psychological resources as competence, self-esteem, and optimism. Inspiration is also seen in literature to have the potential to establish self-determination, because inspiring influences are likely to be regarded as self-congruent (Brien and Epstein‚Äôs, 1988). Most of the review literature assessed inspiration by constraints that measured the feeling of inspiration, or the intrinsic motivation, or openness to experiences or new ideas, or absorption of new behaviour, or a strong desire to master creativity or affect by positive emotion. Also, inspiration was covered by perceived competence or the level of self-esteem or the positive view of oneself or even optimism. In certain literature self-determination was used to reflect the inspiration role toward creating action and engagement with the world of objects or ideas. Absorption as per the literature emerges usually after inspiration promoting diffusion of what is being inspired. The literature also repeatedly shows three variables (perceived competence, self-esteem, and optimism), which suggests that inspiration facilitates the transcendence of constraints and enhances the self. Inspiration involves discovery since it is based on the enhancement of self-determination. Thus inspiration as per the literature helps to create openness to experience and focusing of attention.

1.7	 INSPIRATION AS A SUPERNATURAL SOURCE
Inspiration in its original usage was referred to as an influence by a supernatural source, as inspiration from the Almighty God for the prophets or those given the empowerment from religions or beliefs. For this type of inspiration, the individual is considered as the means to deliver a divine message to his people where inspired individuals would reveal and communicate in different ways what he is being inspired with or about (Leavitt, 1997). Inspiration as a supernatural source remains till today a common term in modern times even for artists, scientists, and other creative individuals that attribute their best ideas, moments or work to creative impulses or an Aha moment that came from transcendent forces (Harding, 1948). Aquinas (1950) saw inspiration as a God given capacity. In theology, the term revelation refers to the disclosure of divine knowledge to the individual, whereas inspiration typically refers to the transmission or translation of the revelation into written form. Inspiration therefore is seen as a motivational state evoked by a revelation (trigger) and directed towards a revealed knowledge that is turned into a text, work or concrete form, and revelations can also be turned into experiences (Hart, 2000). Fauteux (1994) believes that the majority of work on intra-psychic sources of inspiration has focused on the creative rather than the religious domain. Early approaches in psychology attributed inspiration to the unconscious that produces ideas that are more elegant than those manufactured by the will (von Hartmann, 1884; Wallas, 1926).

1.8	 INSPIRATION CREATORS (IBN KHALDUN AS A MODEL)
Throughout humanity we have been finding leaders that come in this life to create a nonreligious legacy that creates an inspiration that travels through the different cultures of humanity without barriers. Many of these inspiring agents are game changers, some of them are society development advocates, some are politicians or philosophers, and some are scholars. We had to select one outstanding individual as an example who has affected different human civilisations with his/her great contribution to resemble what we mean by inspiration creators. Ibn khaldun was our selection. Ibn Khaldun is an outstanding 14th century Arab scholar inspired the world with various branches of knowledge including the philosophy of history, historiography, education, political economy and sociology. Ibn Khaldun studied the rise and decline of nations based on an empirical and rational nature of inquiry. He was the first to develop such an inspiration, i.e. a scientific based approach to the study of human behaviour, society and history, in what is called today social development.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

As the Encyclopaedia Britannica put it, that from ‚Äúmore than 1,000 years between the times of the philosopher Aristotle in ancient Greece and the writer Machiavelli in Renaissance Italy, the most pre-eminent social scientist was Ibn Khaldun, much of whose life was devoted to public service and teaching‚Äù. As a source and creator of inspiration, Ibn Khaldun was attributed to his open minded dual education religious and philosophical sciences, experiences as a public administrator and teacher, besides his passion for the field trials and tribulations he had conducted throughout his life. The main inspiration of Ibn Khaldun comes from his belief that there is a holistic connection between the past, the present and the future. This inspiration was supported by evidence that came from both inductive and deductive methods to derive economic theories and laws. Ibn Khaldun found for example that derived economic theories are governed by economic and social phenomena. The unique inspiration and legacy of Ibn Khaldun comes from the inter-relationships he built between economic, social, political, psychological and religious factors. This rare inspiring scholar managed to make his contribution based on inter-disciplinary, inter-dependence, inter-relation and common international values and beliefs.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

Ibn Khaldun closely observed all sources of inspiration; inspiration areas (as Al-Andalus or Cairo) in his time, inspiration scholars or figures, inspiring history and inspiring wisdom. He started then to link threads between these sources and inspiration trends. Through his closed observations Ibn Khaldun made an analysis and then reflection of these results where he concluded that by focusing on four qualities humans can differ themselves, i.e. be more inspired. As a scholar, by thinking he also saw the big picture and hence he synthesised his observations and classified them and then stratified his collected knowledge and re-wrote it in simple coherent language that can be understood even by a layman. Ibn Khaldun saw that the ability: to think, to fill the natural needs for leading in something unique, thus ensures better ways of living and to fill the natural need for society all help create inspired individuals and inspired communities (Karatas, 2014). For the human being to be inspired and to be an inspirational source, as per Ibn Khaldun, there is a need to be stimulated by utilizing his/her intrinsic spiritual being, economic being, physical being, political being, social being and intelligent being as per Figure (1-1).

Figure (1-1) The Human Being‚Äôs Stimulated Inspirational Constructs, as per Ibn Khaldun

Reviewing his legacy, Ibn Khaldun was one of the earliest scholars who looked at inspiration enhancers. For example, he found that the traits and quality of work increases as a result of doing things repeatedly. While Ibn Khaldun noticed that excessive luxury can create reluctant and blameworthy societies. This mid-centuries scholar resembles how the inspiration creators are visionaries, thus he warned that unless societies are treated in the right time, certain habits would be difficult to get rid of and would have a detrimental effect on society and the environment.

1.9	 INSPIRATION FROM PERSPIRATION TO CREATIVITY
Perhaps the most important obstacle about understanding inspiration is that it is confused with perspiration. Perspiration is productivity driven, while inspiration is about uniqueness in legacy and outcome that lead to innovativeness. Therefore, creativity as per Edison ‚Äúboils down to 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration‚Äù (Edison, Spoken statement, c. 1903; published in Harper‚Äôs Monthly, September 1932) (e.g., Martindale, 2001; Sawyer, 2006). This shows the importance of inspiration on focusing our ‚Äúperspiration‚Äù and efforts towards the betterment of our life and our legacy. Fehrman (1980) offered an explanation of why Inspiration leads to creativity. Most individuals relate creative works to inspiration and not to perspiration, and thus undermine the efforts required to produce the work.

Inspiration is considered to be a predictor of creativity, since there are similarities and relations with certain traits. For example, inspiration and creative self-concept are positively correlated. Thrash & Elliot (2003) observed that inspiration traits also predict objective indicators of creative output. In a sample of U.S. patent holders, inspiration frequency was found to also predict the number of patents held. Even creativity at a personal level can be predicted by inspiration by measuring how self-reported creativity fluctuates together across days (Thrash & Elliot, 2003).

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

While there is considerable variability in the definition and usage of the term creativity within psychology (Silvia & Kaufman, 2010), there is some degree of consensus that creativity implies two qualities: novelty and usefulness (e.g., Feist, 1998; Plucker, Beghetto, & Dow, 2004). We find it useful to explicitly conceptualize creativity as an appraisal of novelty and usefulness that may be applied to any of a variety of objects, particularly ideas and resulting products. Depending on the aims of the research, this appraisal may be made by the creator herself/himself, by gatekeepers within a field, by an audience, or through various other operationalizations available to the researcher. We note that researchers often appear to have either ideas or products in mind as the ultimate objects of creativity appraisals, even when the term ‚Äúcreative‚Äù precedes other nouns (e.g., creative activity [Simonton, 2000], creative insights [Csikszentmihalyi & Sawyer, 1995], creative personalities [Feist, 2010], creative states [Jamison, 1989], or creative processes [Kris, 1952]). Inspiration and creativity involve a clear delineation. Creativity is an appraisal of novelty and usefulness that may apply (to various degrees) to content at any point in the creative process, from a seminal idea to the completed product. Inspiration, in contrast, is a motivational state. We posit that inspiration is often elicited when a creator appraises his or her idea as creative, and it is posited to motivate actualization of the idea in the form of a product that is likewise appraised (by its creator and perhaps others) as creative (Chamorro-Premuzic, 2006; Schuler, 1994). Thrash, et. al. (2010) perceived during a self-reported inspiration study that different types of perspiration when writing (poetry, science, and fiction) help to enhance the creativity of the final product through characteristics such as openness to experience, willingness to execute effort and activated positive activity. Inspiration was found to be a good intermediate variable between the creativity of seminal ideas and the creativity of final products (Thrash, et. al., 2010). The role of ‚Äúperspiration‚Äù in the creative process can be seen when we measure the relation between inspiration with effort and/or work-mastery. Thus, certainly effort is important to the creative process, but its role is different than that of inspiration. In Inspiration, effort is found to be a unique predictor of different aspects of product quality. Inspiration is involved in the generative aspects of the writing process (e.g., inspired writers produce more words and retain more of their original typing). However, effort helps in self-regulation and this can be seen in the type of creativity of the writers who exert effort to delete more words and pause more to think (Thrash, et. al., 2010).

From the above discussion and limited references, one could conclude that the psychological science of inspiration, as well as its relation to creativity, is now well established. Thus much work is expected to fill the gap in the body of knowledge relevant to conceptualization in relevance to inspiration and its relevance to productivity. Also, there are many possibilities for areas of integration of diverse literatures in relevance to inspiration in multiple populations, contexts and levels of analysis. Prior work concerning the neuroscience of inspiration can be used today as a basis for reference for future research.

1.10	 RELATION BETWEEN INNOVATION AND INSPIRATION
Inspiration has received little attention within the scientific community due to a lack of clarity in meaning and its origin in a variety of disciplines such as theology and psychology, as we discussed earlier (Thrash & Elliot, 2003; Carpenter, 1987). Therefore, inspiration has been rarely studied as an integrated definition that leads to innovation. Inspiration and innovation, when they meet, are a source for insight or what is called the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment (Catmull and Wallace, 2014). Others believe that through the inspirational spirit ‚Äòdisruptive innovation‚Äô can be implemented with a focus on reverse thinking and giving a new way on how the world should learn (Christensen et. al., 2011). Therefore, authors like Thrash and Elliot (2004) find that the process of ‚Äúbeing inspired by‚Äù gives rise to the core characteristics of evocation and transcendence, whereas the process of ‚Äúbeing inspired to‚Äù gives rise to the core characteristic of motivation.

1.11	 LEVELS OF INSPIRATION CULTURES
There are four levels of inspiration culture. There are 2 cultures that are considered to be a renovation culture and these are laggard and traditional cultures and they are at the stage of the renovation culture. The laggard culture is a bit slow in adopting innovation even though they might be inspired, the traditional culture are inspired, but still trying to overcome a bureaucratic system to come up with innovation as a result of the inspiration. Then we have the inter stage of innovation cultures, where we have two types of cultures: a pioneer culture where their inspiration leads them to arrive early with an innovation and overcome rigidity and then followed by a world class culture where inspiration leads them to innovate again and again. The more the culture has an appreciation for its self-sufficiency, values, meaning and purpose, social relationships, spirituality, physical and mental wellness, happiness and life satisfaction; the more it can be categorised as being an innovative culture, i.e. more towards being a pioneer and world class in absorbing the inspirational impact and building on it.

1.12	 INSPIRATION AND INSIGHT
Inspiration and insight have been alternatively used in common day to day language and have been even confused in certain literature.¬†First of all let us give a simple fact, inspiration is not just an insight. When a person says that ‚ÄúI had an inspiration‚Äù most probably they meant ‚ÄúI had an insight‚Äù, as insight means a flash of idea(s), but would not necessarily create a proactive self-motivated response (Ohlsson, 1984). The term insight has been used in the literature to describe the process by which a problem solver suddenly moves from a state of not knowing how to solve a problem to a state of knowing how to solve it, as per Mayer (1992). Within the creativity context, insight has also been conceptualized as the cognitive content that enters consciousness suddenly; the ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment (Csikszentmihalyi and Sawyer, 1995). Regardless of its exact usage, insight can be differentiated from inspiration in terms of its theoretical function. Insight is more like an attempt to explain cognitive mechanisms, such as restructuring the way of thinking, by which ideas become more meaningful and people become more aware about its importance. While inspiration is a source of an act or paradigm shift that explains the response that is often followed by high spirit and well to do (Thrash et. al., 2010b).

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

Inspiration does not always come after insight, even though it might if someone carries this insight further. Thrash et. al. (2010b)¬†found that creative ideation tends to lead to inspiration, but that this effect is moderated by the individuals‚Äô approach and temperament (i.e., sensitivity to reward;¬†Elliot and Thrash, 2010). Individuals and communities with focused ambitions might be inspired due to one creative insight, whereas others due to reluctance or unwell to do might have many insights but will not carry it further as a source of inspiration. Our behavioural reactions to insight and/or inspiration have important implications for our achievements and make the difference in life. Even though insight and inspiration both carry a powerful sense of ideation, both will not lead to a legacy unless they are pursued further (Bowden & Jung-Beeman, 2003). Inspiration, however, would have greater chance due to its combined ideation with a positive spirit to draw the thinking toward doing and acting (Thrash, et. al, 2010; Fryer and Ryan, 2010). Bowden and Jung-Beeman (2003) perceived that insightful experiences tend to be associated with the right hemisphere of the brain. However, the left hemisphere of the brain, when exposed to a word, activated only concepts that are closely associated with a word. Hence, the left brain had a limitation of bringing more insightful. Inspiration, however, differs from both insight and creativity since it is uses both brain hemispheres, right and left, to create its impact and even spiral influence. This is why we believe in this handbook that future education needs to focus on the inputs that trigger thinking on both sides of the brain to create such an inspiration. In reality both inspiration and effort play a major part in our future destiny.

1.13	 FUTURE STUDIES
Both positive psychology and neuro-scientific studies have played a major role in the development of the concept of inspiration. A better understanding of the biological basis of inspiration will illuminate the process through which creative ideas ‚Äúfire the soul,‚Äù such that individuals are compelled to transform ideas into products and solutions that may benefit society. This has nourished literature on the subject of inspiration and its role in society and even the socio-economy, even without the need to go into the economic sciences. A great development is expected in this field with the development of technology that can measure how this phenomena called ‚Äòinspiration‚Äô happens and why it stays and intensifies amongst certain people and to shy away from others.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Introduction to Handbook of Inspiration Economy

From a less descriptive and more theoretical standpoint, inspiration may have been conceptualized in terms of both its purpose or function by Thrash and Elliot (2004) and later Thrash et. al. (2010b). Inspiration is found to motivate the transmission of newly appreciated qualities of the evoking object and is found to be a good mediator with different variables. A creative idea may inspire an individual to bring the idea into fruition in the form of a creative invention, or a tangible product and/or service. Thus, inspiration is considered, by Thrashes team at least, to be a motivational¬†response¬†to many creative ideas. With inspiration we can explain the transmission that happens with certain levels of ability to transform a society or come up with different innovations. Many studies need to be developed to explore how inspiration has become situational, a self-driving force and cognitive and noncognitive sometimes (Simonton, 2003;¬†Baas et. al., 2013). The characteristics of inspiration are yet another under studied area that need to be explored. How can we measure these indicators to be used for economic development or even performance measurement? How can we make use of self-reporting tools to measure and operationalize inspiration, this is the same as the phenomenological experience we have when we move certain steps and we get a recording and message from our mobile comparing our performance with our activities and data history.

2	 DEMANDS FOR AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY
2.1	 SOCIETY DEMANDS & INSPIRATION
Inspiration driven activities and services are used more today to raise a communities capacity for meeting society demands. Through inspiration, societies can experience new products and services that improve the quality of life. However, society‚Äôs dynamic demands require new economic enablers that enhance for instance social inclusion and labour market integration. The European Commission 2011 report emphasises the need for new economic resources that address the rising demands of human welfare needs, be it health care, education, resource efficiency and environmental challenges. Through inspiration, humans are selfmotivated and even more equipped to solve social, economic, political, technological and environmental problems.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Demands for an Inspiration Economy

Inspiration raises the capacity of society to meet its demands through raising its ability to identify new opportunities and also its ability to learn. Inspiration raises the ability of individuals and communities to observe, absorb and reflect on all possible market needs, involving seen and hidden competencies. With Inspiration embedded within our societies diverse approaches can be more appreciated (OECD Forum on Social Innovation, 2000).

2.2	 INSPIRATION AND HUMAN DIGNITY
In an era where the management of knowledge, learning and innovation are becoming a goal, inspiration is more and more being linked with human dignity. Inspiration is a spirit that enjoys giving and returning, therefore once repeatedly lived and practiced it helps to build humbleness. Susan Gale had a famous quote that we always repeat to our university students ‚ÄúLife doesn‚Äôt always go according to plan. Heading in a new direction can be scary till you realize how exciting a destination it is‚Äù. This is exactly the description of an inspiring journey. Inspired people are known to establish and control things, but they do not usually work towards owning things. They are a type of people that are inspired to create and give, to plan and work. They care about the pig picture, they are excited and worry about their real dignity when they are not able to give, not when they are not able to take. This is a major difference in perspective of seeing life, isn‚Äôt it?

2.3	 INSPIRATION ‚Äì FROM IMPACT TO INFLUENCE
The word Influence means to have a more consistent and deep impact on society or group of people, i.e. more than just a temporary limited impact. While, influence is linked to legacy and outcome; impact is more about results. Therefore, inspiration is expected to create an influence in areas of high importance to society such as improving the quality of life, lifelong learning, nature preservation or energy conservation, economy, etc. The unique Influence of inspiration is that it leads to sustainability in competitiveness and it is therefore more linked with development, i.e. raising the capacity of achievement, than just raising the resources towards achievement, as in the case of growth based concepts. Inspiration keeps our efforts in development focused on changing the 4 P‚Äôs: i.e. people, process, product and partnership. Inspiration also needs to have more holistic approaches including comprehensive thinking that helps to develop the pig picture. Inspiration is rather a long term accumulated charge that explodes once the next opportunity comes. Inspiration depends on practices that lead to development that focus on ‚Äúwhat to change‚Äù in comparison to other practices that focus usually in growth or ‚Äúhow to change‚Äù. The focus of inspiration on ‚Äúwhat to change‚Äù helps the individual and/or the community to target a status of realization, i.e. the ability to put concepts into reality.

The lack of inspiration around us leads to a lack of reaching the level of influence in our lives, and thus makes us lose the value of our deeds when we measure it on the level of outcomes. Therefore, for example, a government‚Äôs return on capital employed is so little compared to a civil community based organisation‚Äôs efforts for the same project. The inspirational influence and therefore outcome you would get, for example, from a health centre run by a mission hospital is much more than a government centre of the same size or even properly equipped. Why? Simply the spirit of persistence toward achieving specific goals can be seen even in the inspired committed eyes of the medical staff serving in that non-governmental organisation (NGO) and in the non-profit organisation (NPO) hospital, compared to de-motivated government staff.

2.4	 NEED FOR SOCIALISATION AND IE
As humans, we all have a hidden need for a¬†sense of identity¬†that we search for either through socialising with others or through contributions. Life is about achievements, interactions and relationships. Inspiration is the common thread that brings all these three together. The inspiration economy is based on our ability to construct these three indicators with selfdependence; i.e. based on the intrinsic resources within ourselves. We¬†socially construct¬†ourselves to create an image of ourselves through the eyes of other people. Naturally, we like to have a positive self-image, by considering ourselves different or unique or among the best. Socialisation is part of our hidden desirable needs. If we get any type of approval we will see that our possibility for contribution is enhanced, and vice versa when people disapprove we see that ability to be positive becomes limited. This socialisation need creates a powerful cognitive force to create or not create inspiration. Sometimes we re-create our ability to give through creating new associations, including association with our families, friends, job, religion, nationality, and so on. Inspiration therefore, is also related to this new situation once we are stabilised. Joining a new society or a group, and internalizing with such culture, would again make us want to differentiate ourselves so that we start to get inspired again. Socially inspiration due to need comes in different forms. This is in the form of the need to belong or to be associated with a group, or the need for self-esteem or being respected by others, or the need of the feeling of being approved and/or liked by the community.

2.5	 FROM SUPPLY TO CAPACITY VS. DEMAND
The inspiration economy we call for is unique since it avoids ‚Äòpush thinking‚Äô and focuses on ‚Äòpull thinking‚Äô in creating proper change. Thus it is an economy that is not resource dependent rather it is more of an opportunity creator. The inspiration economy is a principle that is beyond productivity too. It is more about selective and focused productivity that leads to competitiveness and differentiation. It is a principle that leads socio-economic behaviours to associate with a change in the mindset towards being active to do activities from trading (supply vs. demand) to focusing on abilities (capacity vs. demand). All the policies in the inspiration economy are therefore based on exposing the psychological potential of making individuals more focused. Influencing people to raise their capacity, without resources, is normally much more difficult than applying a price mechanism rule, therefore the direction of change in the beginning of the transformation towards such a formula is often fuzzy and not easy. The inspiration economy leads to a change in direction. The main emphasis of such an economy should not lie in exporting economics, but rather in importing aspects and insights from other social sciences, into economics.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Demands for an Inspiration Economy

What is needed is a focused effort to overcome current economic models, so that one can utilise the great individuals‚Äô integrated capabilities of the heart, mind, and spirit in a different context; thus utilising emotions, without any cognitive limitations, to produce a unique contribution. With the advent of social media and the enlargement of the size of professional and knowledge communities, personal networks are becoming another source of extrinsic stimulus to inspiration. It is another source of the capacity vs. demand formula. With capacity vs. demand, we have another superior formula working in the background, called ‚ÄòOverall Productivity Effectiveness‚Äô (OPE). OPE is very important for the measurement of the shift and transformation towards and inspiration economy. OPE is a real measure of society, community, organisations and even individual ability to be available with high readiness to deliver the best fitness for purpose, with the most efficient and cost effective outcome. Therefore, one can measure the percentage of real development of capacity vs. demand by measuring the percentage of OPE achieved by any organisation or society through the following formula: OPE = Availability x Quality x Efficiency. While inspiration plays a major role in enhancing the OPE score as per our experience; societies, communities, organisations and individuals, they will not achieve their best capacity without being motivated and even inspired to. Raising the OPE score means raising the opportunities of quantity and variety, thus with more probability for socio-economic stability and sustainability. This step of achieving true social stability, quality of life and happiness we call development. The inspiration economy focuses on this type of step which we call ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô not ‚Äògrowth‚Äô. We grow resources and relevant results, but we develop outcomes and legacy. If you review all the future economies literature, you will find a considerable amount pointing the way for this need of development not growth. More inspiration in this way means an easier journey towards development.

2.6	 INSPIRATION AND QUALITY OF LIFE
Reviewing inspiration history and its impact on societies it has been found to cause a lot of direct and indirect quality of life indicators to move upwards. For example, according to academic research, inspiration is highly correlated with the rise of self-esteem and it improves both individual and society‚Äôs confidence, as well as making people feel better about themselves. Inspiration reduces life uncertainty and creates sense of direction. With inspiration we can observe how speed and acceleration create positive change in communities‚Äô settings. Complexity is seen as part of life challenges that need and can be bypassed. Also, increasing multicultural and population mobility is seen more and more as a source of inspiration than a source of conflict.

Inspiration is found to build a lot of inter-generational ties and create a sense of citizenship and belonging. Countries and societies that are less fortunate in their level of quality of life are found to be deprived due to their poor ability to use what they have been gifted with human capacity. In order to develop the quality of life we need to control citizens‚Äô unpredictability and enhance their feeling of flexibility with agility of services provided for their benefit. Inspiration once spread in a community will overcome any scarcity of resources and ensure sustainability. The more a society directs its inspiration towards transparency and accountability the more we have a shift towards unique paradigms. Quality of life is about more opportunities and alternatives for the choices of life. The more we can keep alternatives and choices for us to deal with in life, the more our brains are stimulated. We all want different things in life and throughout our life; this is why an inspiration economy is a strongly supported economy, as it works on the wealth of alternatives and multi-choices, rather than just materialistic wealth. A country or a society‚Äôs capital in an inspiration economy will enhance the amount of choices it has to utilize that capacity. In stable and semi-stable economies inspiration can help a lot of individuals to overcome the different challenges and circumstances in front of them. With the inspiration economy there are no barriers for creating friendships and collaborations. The communities in such societies are more vibrant and a lot of NGOs and society voluntary activities are the norm for both major local and international events. Today there are early trials happening in this area in certain academic and socio-economic institutions. For example, London South Bank University (LSBU) established a programme called the ‚ÄòIndividual Profile in Active Citizenship‚Äô (IPAC) a few years ago with the purpose of establishing the alternatives and empowering people of all ages and backgrounds in London with learning tools that enhance their opportunities and choices. As per the LBSU, such a programme encourages people to take up a challenge and encourages groups to think about aspects of community life that offer challenges and opportunities for involvement. Recognizing that we have many choices to select in our life journey enhances our mental and physical wellbeing by encouraging us to seek to utilise many of their opportunities.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Demands for an Inspiration Economy

The demand for government departments in an inspiration economy would shift or be balanced from only ministries of health or education, to ministry of cultural affairs. The role of the Culture Affairs Department would be improving the quality of life for all, thus allowing people to derive pleasure and to fulfil their own potential and broaden their horizons. Therefore, cultural services would play a crucial role tackling social exclusion, contribution to regeneration, promoting safer communities, encouraging healthier lifestyles, providing opportunities for voluntary and community activity and stimulating lifelong learning, which all contributes towards inspiration in the socio-economic setting. Inspiration based practices are found to significantly enhance self-efficacy and inter-dependence. Through inspiration our capacity to respond flexibly to changing circumstances would be higher. Also, due to the variety of learning resources many would have more opportunity to rediscover their legacy in this life journey. These feelings are worth millions.

2.7	 INSPIRATION AND SOCIAL COHESION
There will be no real achievements for a country‚Äôs national competitiveness programme without a strong coexistence programme. Coexistence and competitiveness go hand in hand. Only countries that have managed to implement and establish effective social cohesion programmes are able to bring about productive citizens that provide value added to the broader community.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Demands for an Inspiration Economy

In an inspiration economy all the efforts of education and professional institutions are around creating harmony in productivity processes. Through inspiration we build what we call a critical inquiring mind that loves learning and has a great directed curiosity of discovering and, at the same time has, the ability to see things from an overall viewpoint. Inspiration can be studied, more and more, as part of human behavioural research. The inquiring mindset can then be linked to personality constructs such as ‚Äòopenness‚Äô and ‚Äòchange readiness‚Äô. In an inspirational based economy, social harmony can be supplied by social media or faceto-face. Such interactions release a hormone called¬† oxytocin, which helps people bond and care for others, and also helps individuals handle stress better. Through more volunteering we are be able to meet others more, make friends, and bond over common beliefs and goals. Oxytocin spreads the feeling of social unity and gives us a deep sense of happiness at the same time. With such a hormone we are inspired to participate more in healthy and cohesive community projects that address social cohesion.

2.8	 MARKET FAILURE AND SOCIAL DILEMMAS
Markets generally fail in the production of public goods and/or services; and nobody can be excluded from the consumption of these goods and/or services. Social dilemmas exist when a considerable number of socio-economic services are affected by practices which are across our systems designs and there are no parallel programs that control this. For example, one of the social dilemma‚Äôs in rich Arab developing countries is the over consumption of energy per capita, with no real effective programmes for energy saving. Besides the issue of environmental pollution, these countries always work on the concept of supply vs. demand; with no or limited efforts really for capacity vs. demand that can help to meet rising consumption. Even though many opportunities for both business and social entrepreneurship today are in this area, only mega projects can be seen in the response of government controlled utility services. It is a type of real market failure even if it is not admitted. Social dilemmas then can be addressed through an economically driven mindset that inspires the current generation to consider waste or opportunity as the real enemy and not governments or profit driven companies. If this mindset is established in any culture it will differentiate it to be a waste-free society. Typically, more like the booming ‚Äô80s of the Japanese culture. An inspiration economy therefore overcomes many social dilemmas through the possibility of self-organisation, self-regulation and selfless attitudes that help to mitigate the consequences of market failure. The traditional economic approach disregards such possibilities.

2.9	 ROLE OF ‚ÄúINSPIRATION ASSETS‚Äù IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY
The powers of positive thinking, had been discussed and researched extensively in the last one decade as a power that help into the application of the law of attraction to achieve our dreams smoother and faster. Inspiration plays a major role in our society today and it is in high demand. Just see how inspirational quotes on shirts with bold fonts are going out stock, or how tweets for positive inspirational messages are shared and you will understand the amount of business that can be relevant to this. We can confirm that most positive instagrams are liked the most, because people like the same. Inspirational programmes, speeches, projects, countries, places, leaders, friends are all popular to us because they ‚Äúwake up‚Äù something within us. Inspiration is based on action not just promises, words, talk and stories. Also if inspiration happens it generates action.¬† Inspirational talks without actions create what we call inspirational saturation. If we study TED-talks success it is not because of social media only, or managing to bring the best speakers, no, it is actually about empowering people to share what inspired them. The social web also plays a role in inspiration too by keeping users interacting, reading, challenging, reflecting; thus sharing the ‚Äòlikes‚Äô to each other. As inspiration flows, this creates value, which use to be called, until today, a Knowledge-Asset or ‚ÄòK-Asset‚Äô, we would like to call it from now on in this handbook an inspirational asset or ‚ÄòI-Asset‚Äô. Since what TED and IKEA are doing is very similar, they are exploring and extracting the assets of inspiration, we have ‚ÄòI-Assets‚Äô, and are using it as a means of asking for more. This cannot be bought by money, but can be optimised by design. ‚ÄòI-Assets‚Äô depend on the type of interface we use to open our metaphor towards a real world of opportunities. It is an economic design that can be integrated with any business model to bring the best of both the service provider and the beneficiary. We as humans, represented by organisations and society movements, are rapidly realizing the power of discovering ourselves, i.e. the power of dealing with how we think, react and aspire. Some of this realisation comes from intrinsic sources as experience, reflections or results of challenges or failures; others come from extrinsic sources. We get excited when we interact with a new process of learning or a challenge that pulls us or pushes us to explore. This is the essence of an inspirational asset. Without such a feeling of inspiration today, all the technology, knowledge and data around us would make no sense. Even as we are talking more about the quality of life, this will not make sense unless it is linked to a type of inspirational asset that keeps you going.

Therefore, one can consider that inspiration is not a luxury, or it is not any more linked to the elite of society, it is rather considered to be an edge for survival. In fact, an inspirational asset is already becoming a differentiation for the level of respect to human dignity that a government, or a company, or superior is willing to offer or obliged to offer. So, the issue today and tomorrow will not be about salary or income, but about how much one can be inspired to stay with an organisation. With inspiration we will not be a copy of one another and we will ensure that we will not lose our uniqueness. With inspiration we appreciate, are aware and then even get to a state of realisation about the purpose of our existence. Hence, through inspiration and inspiration only can we enrich humanity again with its purpose for existence which sometimes, or most of the time, we seem to forget. One can claim that Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google are valued at billions of dollars today just for their ability to be a consistent source for inspiration and hope for millions of people around the globe regardless of social status, nationality and power. Services of these social media based companies not only help people to¬†easily connect, but also share inspiring and positive achievements. Besides it is a type of empowerment to inspire anyone you can reach and move them towards action.

Thus through this power of inspiration, whether electronic or physical, we can move communities and individuals to commit resources, thoughts and perspectives toward more focused and meaningful experiences. Capitalizing on inspiration economy techniques is the secret of success of why many social enterprises and start-ups are more appealing than any other business to the youth of today.

2.10	 RESTRUCTURING THE ECONOMY WITH INSPIRATION
Anielski (2015) called for virtuous actions and a new form of ‚Äúgenuine capitalism with a heart and wisdom‚Äù; supported by bold efforts in order to restructure the global economic architecture that aligns more closely to measuring happiness and values. Alternatively, the world we live in today, as can be seen, is really struggling to find the alternatives of what the next economy is. We need to re-define what we mean by growth and development, with relevance to ‚Äòvalue added activities‚Äô and defined ‚Äòsustainable outcomes‚Äô. We need to structure the economy with ‚Äòvalue based thinking‚Äô, while taking care of productivity and ensuring moral and qualitative value of all types of capital assets. As per our search in the last three years, we believe that an ‚ÄòInspirational based Economy‚Äô is a straight forward restructuring and transformation principle that narrows the gap between both rich and poor countries, societies and individuals. Inspiration for rich societies means searching for happiness and equality, while inspiration for poor societies means looking for chances and choices for economic prosperity and quality of life within available resources. In today‚Äôs Knowledge Economy (KE), everyone can reach and possess information and therefore react to it, since we are in the era where information is used to trigger our interests. With high availability and huge variety of knowledge available to us today and more in the future, we are expected to be inspired with practices and services that are relevant to the KE. Utilisation of this knowledge capacity is supposed to move our spirits, hearts and minds towards a higher level of human contributions, in more focused and effective ways. But, this did not happen as expected. Therefore, many scientists started talking in the last few years about more related socio-economic practices, such as the ‚ÄòInnovation Economy‚Äô, or ‚ÄòLearning Economy‚Äô. We, the authors of this handbook started to see that all these economies would not be totally and holistically integrated and connected without the ‚ÄòInspiration Economy‚Äô. Definitely, we believe that the world is set for a new restructuring in its economy otherwise it would continue its exponential turbulent journey.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Demands for an Inspiration Economy

If we restructure the economy with inspiration, this would help us to come out of our contained boxes, therefore creating a new wave of thinking that motivates us for a new paradigm or accepting a new lifelong challenge. The waves that inspiration creates with such restructuring, pushes us to accept the dynamics and the hidden hills of change, even if we get out of our safe zones. With inspiration we will overcome, during restructuring, the ego and closed-minded characteristics that we usually face and now are still spreading within our societies. Greece, Italy, Spain, the UK and many other examples are now far from our memories to remember what happened during efforts to restructure with a proper inspiration programme. Thus such a spirit of inspiration leads us to overcome the consistent focus on the necessities, to rather strive harder to differentiating ourselves and going out of our way; therefore learning more, and enhance our capacity to innovate more and more as we transform. In this era, without inspiration, we are surely going to strain ourselves through simply being a copy of history. Through establishing the practices of inspiration while trying to restructure economies, we learn to think out of the box and even take decisions out of the box. This means with a society and an economy driven by inspiration we are willing to take many risks in order to fulfil seeing the pig picture. Yes, inspiration gives us the spirit of discovering what we know and what we do not yet think about. With inspiration, we can also overcome solid walls within our comfort zone that we built, or built in our minds, due to accumulated years of experience that we engulfed ourselves in. Inspiration during restructuring the condition of the paradigm pushes towards preferring the routine conditions and system dependent environments over life challenges. ‚ÄúIf you want to know what is behind the door, you just need to be inspired enough to just open it‚Äù (Arabic proverb). Without inspiration, any efforts for restructuring are very difficult to create out of the box. Without such inspiration we do not strive to discover something unique within us that makes us enrich the world by being resource independent. Without inspiration the world would come to a status called of saturation. It is an area of the status quo, as we are going around ourselves and we can see this clearly in the last few years even with the fast development of the technologies and the uprising of more developing and emerging economies.

2.11	 ‚ÄòCREATIVE CLASS‚Äô AND INSPIRATION ECONOMY
In ‚ÄúThe Rise of the Creative Class‚Äù the economist Richard Florida points out that many leading developing countries are shifting to have a new social class similar to the middle class, however it produces with limited resources and little waste called the ‚ÄòCreative Class‚Äô. Florida pointed out that this can be seen clearly today in cities such as Stockholm and Helsinki where most of the population works on developing knowledge and culture, as in education, research, literature and art, rather than producing material goods.

Florida emphasised how cultural activities lead in a natural way to global co-operation, since they only flourish by sharing and or being used for more inspiration in others. It is an economy that is based on cultural achievements and shared societies‚Äô inheritance and knowledge that is growing faster than ever before. Florida saw this as a pattern for the future, and maintains that everyone is capable of creativity.

2.12	 FULL WORLD AND INSPIRATION ECONOMICS
The exponential growth of the human population and the limitation of economic activities have narrowed the distance towards an ‚Äòempty-world‚Äô situation. It is a situation in which we reach the absolute limits of the earth‚Äôs carrying capacity and just on the purge of collapse. ‚ÄòFull-world‚Äô economics is similar to the concept of the Inspiration Economy. Both claim to be part of a needed future economy, where we no longer are able to rely on industrial growth to give profits or to solve problems of unemployment or to alleviate poverty problems; due to reaching sustainable limits. Unfortunately, all the traditional based theories are pushing the world rapidly towards scarcity based economies, i.e. an ‚Äòempty-world‚Äô.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Demands for an Inspiration Economy

The theory of the neoclassical economy, for example, shows that by substituting man-made capital for natural resources it is very limited and even not practical. With the further limitation factors in the rapidly vanishing supplies of oil, gas and metal ores, forests and fish; the need for an inspirational based economy is highly appreciated. Inspiration supports the compensation of resource depletion by the supply of motivated human capital or even technology. The inspiration economy can help to enhance the capacity of development compared to the total number of humans, and consumption per capita. As the reserves of oil and other important natural resources are likely to be rare or exhausted by the end of this century, while the world population reaches 9 billion or more, compounded by possibilities of war and other disorders; risks of both famine and death would reach an unprecedented scale in history. Unless humanity makes prompt and well-structured actions, there will be unimaginable proportions of tragic human loss and an ‚Äòempty-world‚Äô situation will be a reality. Through an inspiration economy we can still shift towards a more stabilized population that controls issues of famine and poverty and ensures safe water, sanitation, elementary education, primary health care and proper nutrition for all. Inspiration also needs to push women to a higher status, because these social reforms have proved to be strongly correlated with lower birth rates and a better quality of life. A ‚Äòfull-world‚Äô economy will not be based on what possessions we have, or any means for that would fill only the purpose of social competition, and will not be controlled by a limited human ego. Actually, a ‚Äòfull-world‚Äô economy means that we depend on different sources of inspiration as renewed values to replace old unproductive paradigms that have been based on excessive consumption.

2.13	 WHY AN INSPIRATION BASED ECONOMY IS NEEDED?
Inspiration is one of the tools to balance a strange and unstable economy, since inspiration can create a society that evaluates things differently and simply. Due to missing values, today for example, one cannot explain why only the top 1% of humans are making billions that outweighs by about 380 times more than the average middle class. Complexity of modern society is also increasing more and more with technology and globalization. Therefore, positive motivational concepts such as inspiration are highly needed to ease people‚Äôs life journey. Inspiration help discover more value added practices in relevance to the economy, thus mitigating risks and increasing the probability of leaving a legacy. Inspiration can lead to an open competitive and transparent environment where people tend to share their ideas, and thus establish an entrepreneurial innovative and vibrant society.

The ability to inspire or be inspired is now a more frequent and consistent trend, as compared to 20 years ago, and it has certainly been more progressive in the last few years. Inspiration is no more about motivation for higher performance, it is more becoming a core value for evaluating things (Dunlap and Grabinger, 2003; Hart, 2000; and Hunter and Schmidt, 1993). Inspiration is needed today, especially with the instability of social, economic and political environments. Inspiration is needed more than ever since it can influence building a common purpose among diverse communities (Iverson, 2011;¬†Hart, 1998). When we inspire people we can involve them in the implementation of a needed social transformation, as inspiration gives a sense of independence and an ability to be autonomous and unique. Inspiration is needed since an inspired person means today he/she can be more self-serving, participative and self-confident, thus it is a change to any country‚Äôs economy (Hart, 2000). Inspiration is needed since it is one of the best resilience tools for any cultural environment. With inspiration we can develop better expectations, experiences, needs and interaction patterns within our communities.

2.14	 THE POWER OF IDEAS SPILL OVER
The basis of the inspiration economy is a greater quantity, higher quality and wider diversity of ideas, innovation and learning in combination with the spirit of entrepreneurship. The raw material for such a combination effect is the ability to find opportunities and capitalise on ideas.

Demands for an Inspiration Economy

Today with an open knowledge based economy, spillovers occur more than ever where ideas are put into action and also actions lead to ideas. Inspiration happens here, with a high flow and it leads people to want to contribute more and more and thus creates a sense of cohesion. Spillovers happen through an open innovative environment, where we work together with customers, suppliers or even competitors to arrive at ideations and inspirations different from those we obtain by traditional routes. Partnerships between sectors help people to seek out and find new ideas and opportunities and above all be inspired by other people, sectors or applications of a different style of thinking. The power of cross sectors and a cross discipline spillover of ideas is that they open a lot of blind spots in our life. Thus this offers us enormous opportunities, to do further research into the important flows of ideas between diverse people and businesses. In an inspiration economy, there would be no constraints or internal forces and unhealthy competition that restrict ideas for a spill over, as we see today. With idea spill overs, people feel free to explore many horizons. During this process of a spill over we can dare to try and even go to the level of humility of trying ideas without a feel of failure. Therefore, such power is really demanded more and more today for better competition, allowing us to be able to see the big picture and learn to think without borders.

2.15	 THE CHALLENGE OF OPERATIONALIZING INSPIRATION
Operationalizing any concept is usually the most difficult part of it as a discipline. The term ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù has been used in a variety disciplines, especially in literature, psychology, economy and social studies. Inspiration historically has also been studied in a domain-specific manner, with little communication between researchers across domains. Recognizing the need for a holistic and/or integrated definition of the inspiration construct, both Thrash and Elliot (2003, 2004) undertook the task of developing a domain-general conceptualization that draws upon the core commonalities of inspiration across diverse literatures. Thrash and Elliot found that becoming inspired by a stimulus object, such as a person, an idea, or a work of art, evokes and sustains inspiration episodes. During inspiration, the individual or the group might gain awareness of new possibilities that transcend within. Then this awareness turns towards more of a realisation that creates a basis for execution, sharing, transmitting and expressing the inspiration asset and status carried.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Demands for an Inspiration Economy

While trying to operationalize inspiration Thrash and Elliot (2004) argued that inspiration involves two distinct processes. These two processes start with a relatively passive process called being ‚Äòinspired by‚Äô, then followed by a relatively active process called being ‚Äòinspired to‚Äô. The process of being ‚Äòinspired by‚Äô involves an appreciation of the perceived intrinsic values of the stimulus source, whereas the process of being ‚Äòinspired to‚Äô involves motivating current actualization and extending it to other parties. In their field study both Thrash and Elliot (2004) asked the participants to recall either the time when they were inspired, or the baseline experience controlled condition. The inspiration narratives varied from becoming awakened by a scientific or artistic insight, to discovering one‚Äôs calling, to being influenced by a role model, to realizing and reflecting that greatness is possible. Researchers confirm that we need to use inspiration more and more to serve unique approach functions as it is a powerful principle that motivates the transmission or expression of the newly appreciated qualities of the evoking object (Thrash & Elliot, 2004; Thrash, et. al., 2010).

2.16	 SPIRIT OF INSPIRATION IN RESEARCH
Research is being turned more and more towards being multi-disciplined, after it became so narrowed by sub-specialities that have spread since the ‚Äô80s until the last decade. In order to push the spirit of inspiration in the research we need to go to a level that will allow us to use knowledge holistically so that we can empower and enrich research outcomes. This means consideration needs to be given to an integral driver of sustainable development and societal transformation research. Thus establishing a lifelong learning society committed to inspiration. In an inspiration based economy competitive research in the future must have the capacity to generate, diffuse, utilize and protect knowledge in order to create a participation that will improve economic wealth and social equity. The researchers need to have an integrated view that reflects efforts of putting their heart, mind and spirit into a scientific project. In order to establish disciplined inspired research in our scientific, academic and education societies we need to prioritise areas that need attention, and network ideas with all people of concern. Also we need to try things out on behalf of the practitioners or with them, closely monitor and for an evaluation of society‚Äôs needs. An inspiring economy research would be unique in both risk taking and risk analysis. The research would apply ‚Äúpull thinking‚Äù in a review and observation for the area of study, such as: what is happening in this area? Where are the signs of relevant good practice? How can ideas and people be connected through research and the body of knowledge? Will this work in other disciplines? What can be put into practice? What is the next practice?

3	FOUNDATIONS & PRINCIPLES OF ‚ÄòWHAT IS AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY?‚Äô
3.1	 WHAT IS INSPIRATION?
Many dictionaries define inspiration as being someone or something that gives us¬†ideas¬†for doing something better. It is described by some as ‚Äúbeauty of the blue sky after being lost on an empty desert‚Äù. Others, describe their experience with inspiration as the ‚Äòpure air we breathe‚Äô, since it simulates us to see the way forward. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED, 2014) defines inspiration as ‚Äúa breathing in or infusion of some idea, purpose, etc. into the mind; the suggestion, awakening, or creation of some feeling or impulse, especially of an exalted kind‚Äù. Inspiration as a noun is seen as the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially to do something creative. It might also mean the quality of being inspired or the source of that which inspires (OED, 2014).

Foundations & Principles of ‚ÄòWhat is an Inspiration Economy?‚Äô

Inspiration play a role in stretching our limits as human beings thus discovering more the benefits of abundance thinking which leads more creative solutions in solving uprising life problems (Hendrick, 2009). Thus with inspiration we can expect to be energetic as (Hart, 1998) mentions with more abundant driven open mindset. The actions or power that inspiration creates towards moving intellect or emotions by making people put their thoughts into action is unique and very difficult to imitate. Without the belief in inspiration we might not even think to change the course in our life when we are unhappy about its outcomes. Inspiration makes us take extra risks in life to pursue our dreams and persist towards achieving them, even if we fail time after time. As shown by Thrash, et. al. (2010), inspiration is needed more than ever today to support the production of creative work. Through inspiration one would understand what the good life is. Social relationships, work and income, health and societal benefits; are all affected by inspiration. Inspired people are more likely to have self-confidence and the ability to optimize constraints, with a variety of approaches to learning. Inspiration is a word that makes you feel you have added feathers to your arms and now you would take off and fly. It is a word that also means that you start seeing things from a different perspective which you never seen before. Therefore as practitioners would, inspiration can best be described by authors, musicians and artists who usually bring novel original work that cannot be easily copied. Such inspiration requires us to be patient, to take the full responsibility for the journey and most of all expand our sense of the possible. In a Nun study carried by Snowdon et. al. (2007), the scientists studied how the role of positive emotions create a difference in happiness. Happy and less happy nuns living in same life circumstances through their lifespan were compared. The study found that 79% of the happy inspired nuns were in the most cheerful quartile, where they believed that their society benefits because of their happiness too. These happy nuns are found also to be the most volunteering with high pro-peace cooperative attitudes. Inspiration therefore, is very important for social relationships, appropriate adaptation, society, culture positive thinking styles and most of all a high contribution. This study shows that happiness and inspiration go hand in hand and that this style if it can be generalised to society would support the harmony of a socio-economy status. Once people are inspired they focus on ‚Äòwhat is right‚Äô rather than ‚Äòwho is right‚Äô and precisely define their mission and work on pursuing it. With inspiration people work towards dignity and are committed towards more powerful contributions.

Inspiration as a concept is used in many disciplines today such as education (Korthagen, and Greene, 2012), psychology (Hart, 1998 and Lockwood & Kunda, 1997), anthropology (Leavitt, 1997), theology (Canale, 1994), arts, design and literature (Harvey, 1999), management (Bass and Avolio, 1994; Dess and Picken, 2000) and engineering (Beer et. al., 1997). One could say that the word inspiration is highly linked with a unique sustained intrinsic energization that influences the behaviour or even transforms it to a new level (Elliot, 1997). In Buheji et. al. (2014) we have seen inspiration as a form of human persistence to achieve, change, transform or model a visualised goal.

3.2	 ‚ÄòGROWTH VS. DEVELOPMENT‚Äô AND THE INSPIRATION ECONOMY
A country‚Äôs economy is described to be healthy and it is progressing towards development if the gross national product increases steadily by 4 to 5% annually. However, it is obvious that such economic growth cannot continue to be indefinitely (Avery, 2015). Many people do not distinguish between growth and development. While we might have productivity growth, it is very difficult to visualise competitiveness as growth. This is especially true, if the competitiveness is based on intrinsic resources, innovations and organisational learning. While you can grow in size, production capacity and delivery; you can only develop if you change your capability, changeability and competency. Development usually happens based on self-discovery, cultural impact and knowledge reflection. Development is about realised outcomes that are delivered mainly through qualitative improvements and milestones for society. If it is inspirational development, then it will be without extra resources or with minimal resources. When development occurs, our capacity develops verses the demand. Thus our capacity in production would be based on less resources, pollution and time, or even less constraints of design and delivery. Thus, development is a major source for inspirational economy differentiation. If we have the concept of development vs. growth well established in our culture we hopefully see less banks involved in financial crisis and collapses like those witnessed in 2008. Development based inspiration does not treat symptoms, it treats phenomena. Development goes deep to the roots through selective ‚Äòpull thinking‚Äô to overcome repeated faults and infiltrates from the system. Growth is not similar to Development. From life experiences and reflection from many projects relevant to Inspirational or Competitiveness Labs one can clearly see growth is more of an evolution, while development would have to go through a restoration stage before it make another revolution to a new concept.

Services that have no resource constraints can easily develop without major changes, however, in case of limitations to these services we need inspirational development that creates a smooth transition towards a sustainable or circular economy.

3.3	 PRACTICES OF AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY
An inspiration economy is relevant to certain practices relevant to organisations or society that are available today. For society, there are practices and programmes relevant to an inspiration economy as programmes of society‚Äôs inspiration, social engineering, society co-existence, or social integration programmes. Thus, it is believed today that equal opportunity, diversity management and gender equality are all sources for an inspiration based economy. While for organisations, inspirational relevant practices focus on Organizational Learning, Organizational Innovation, Organizational Competitiveness, Organizational Excellence, and Organizational Knowledge Management.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Foundations & Principles of ‚ÄòWhat is an Inspiration Economy?‚Äô

To cover the wide and fast developing scope of an inspiration related economy one has to cover the new and potentially future economy drivers which are represented by: the Knowledge Economy, Learning Economy, Innovation Economy, Service Economy, Experience Economy and Welfare Economy and which we discuss in greater detail in Chapter 9. Practices of inspiration are also relevant today to innovation practices and programmes, such as: Disruptive Innovation, Accelerated learning, Government Innovation Programmes, Society Development, Entrepreneurship Spirit, Business of Inspiration, Organizational Psychology and Social Innovation. All inspirational economy practices depend on the principles of psychodynamics, cognitive approaches, trust, autonomy, self-initiative and even empathy.

3.4	 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE ECONOMY
Inspiration Economy as a new concept comes mainly from two fields Psychology and Economic. If we talk about inspiration and entrepreneurship we have to cover also behavioral economics where the work Simon (1978) and Katona (!975) would be highly recognised. Economic theories are built usually on the basis of addressing how humans can make decisions. However, over the last three decades, there has been a large development with relevance to positive psychology and socio-economic behaviours. Due to this important development cognitive and emotional theories started to shadow reality requirements, especially in the role of behavioural anomalies such as happiness, wellbeing and inspiration on the economy. Also, demands on traditional, service and experiential economies support the shift towards an inspirational economy as shown in Figure (3-1).

3.5	 INSPIRATION THROUGH UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIO-ECONOMY
Most economic theories today start from a non-accurate assumption that we as people are selfish when it comes to the way we react to the market (Becker, 1976). However, luckily inspiration found to support people to be more giving and taking. Profound inspiration targets to enhance socio-economic setting through addressing the influence of society‚Äôs behaviour. Inspiration through learning by doing should focus on practices that enhance non-selfish behaviour through enhancing our role in minimising the impact of different social dilemmas. With the introduction of social experimental techniques into the discipline of economics, scientists including psychologists, can provide better predictions compared with actual behaviour. Today more papers and evidence based books are published based on observed behaviour in relevance to social norms and preferences; including for example integrity, productivity and transparency which support the development of an established stable and sustainable socioeconomic and trustworthy system. Inspiration thus can enhance the type of reciprocity that exists in our societies.

3.6	 SOCIAL DESIRABILITY AND INSPIRATION
Social desirability is one of the economy related society motivational tools today, whereby it sees what the society is driven by and what others think about it. Thus, social desirability creates much of how people behave. This can affect the economy as people are always driven by others‚Äô approval and liking. Society is founded on three steps: explanations, motivations and social desirability. The essence of the influence of inspiration on social desirability and well-being was examined in many recent studies. Social desirability was found to occur with the manipulation of extraordinary competence which increased inspiration. The inspiration trait, on the other hand, helps to trigger well-being variables, i.e. increasing the positive affect, life satisfaction, vitality, and self-actualization (Buheji et. al., 2014). Buheji et. al. (2014) emphasis that when inspiration meets personal goals, positive well-being occurs. These effects happen when the purpose of life is realised. Once people become aware about a specific social need, or after learning by doing, then they feel an incredible urge to transmit their accumulated knowledge or perspectives to others. Here a good example is where social desirability coincides with inspiration characteristics, where awareness of some undiscovered possibility transpires from outside the conscious mind, and an urge to transmit this awareness leads to the status of realization.

Social desirability based inspiration then has three characteristics: Feeling of an extra selfempowerment which makes us become aware of the vast opportunities that we have not recognized or appreciated before, a realization of the conscious mind and a feeling for inspiring others where an urge to transmit to other members of society or an open insight for others to see the opportunities. Research into inspiration has shown that when individuals observe a remarkable action they often feel inspired (Thrash et. al., 2010). When inspired, they often write and generate output more efficiently and concisely that what comes in (Thrash and Elliot, 2010). Hence, social desirability has a determinate effect on inspiration.

3.7	 LIFELONG LEARNING AS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION
Lifelong Learning (LLL) is a concept that targets to inspire learning for everyone, regardless of their age, profession, education, capabilities, etc. Through volunteering programmes, for example, even older people or those in home care can share LLL and benefit from discussions that lead to knowledge capturing and the enhancement of life satisfaction. The goal of LLL programmes is to keep people involved and then inspire them towards making their societies more vibrant and complete with the quality of life.

LLL is also linked to the spirit of volunteering as it is considered one of the means of informal learning. There are today hundreds of lifelong learning volunteering programmes, that are based on learning and serving, that foster building a society with an active youth in developed and developing countries, however none are linked to the concept of inspiration (Geali, 2008). Lifelong Learning (LLL) programmes have been found to enhance the motivation people to share and learn. ‚ÄòBest Practice Visits‚Äô, staff or expertise sharing programmes, conferences, workshops or seminar attendance and participation are types of lifelong learning practices that lead first to motivation and then raise the possibility for inspiration. Focused and implementation driven workshops are also found to be a good tool for LLL as they bring together individuals or small groups of learners, who may be from multinational and even multi-disciplined backgrounds. LLL is about the learning experience relevant to our personal development and learning needs. The more we understand how our LLL works, the better we know where we are going to use it towards an effective outcome, i.e. including making it a source of inspiration, (Bell et.al., 2009). In-service training, for long time, has been a source of lifelong learning for organisational staff. Many leading companies since the early ‚Äô50s of the last century have carried programmes for adult education, where staff are expected to attend structured courses to meet company requirements. Many world class companies, still today, have direct and indirect internal/ external programmes to improve their staff practical, strategic, learning, communication, teaching, coaching, counselling and management skills. This is, in fact, part of the norm in a lot of medium and large organisations in Europe today.

3.8	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY MINDSET
Inspiring people are known for their ability to create influence compared to others. When we talk about an inspiring mindset, we mean the ability of our personality to create and deal with conditions that lead to exposing people potentials. (Buheji, 2015d). This influence means that you are able to promote harmony with nature and thereby provide sustainability for future generations with the ability to create communities of reciprocal care and shared responsibility (Allen, et. al, 1998).

The inspiration mindset is becoming very important for the world as its population will grow to 9 billion by 2050 and developing countries will become closer in adopting business growth models. Stalnaker (2009) observes that economic theory always suggests circular growth, and this can happen without an open mindset. The same is also true for the practices of inspiration and innovation which are spreading into different countries‚Äô economies, and between different generations, genders and communities overcoming many life limitations. The ability to inspire a mindset or get it inspired has now more probability to be a frequent and consistent trend as compared to 20 years ago. It has more certainly been progressive in the last few years. Inspiration of a mindset is not any more about motivation for higher performance, it is becoming more of a core value for evaluating things. An inspiration of mindset is a spirit that is needed today more than ever with rapid waves of frequent instability, since it has the influence to build a common purpose among a diverse community. When we inspire people through a specific socio-economic paradigm, this means we can engage and involve them in the implementation of a needed social transformation and this leads to a prepared mindset to replicate the same experience to change the world. A true wave of social inspiration should give a sense of independence, besides the ability of the mindset to be autonomous and to think of unique contributions. An inspired community will have a mindset of self-serving, participation and self-confidence. Additionally, an inspirational economy will focus on inspiration that can build communities that have a differentiation in overcoming challenges, have the ability to see the unseen or see things in different ways and even might have the ability to alleviate psycho-social problems. It is time for such a spirit driven economy, which is based on the trend of high youth unemployment all over the world. It is time for an inspiration based economy since humanity is searching eagerly today for a value based wealth that can contribute to a quality of life economy, where opportunities and support are more based on intrinsic resources than extrinsic ones. This creates a movement to society attitudes and habits of inter-dependence and similarly promotes social innovation. Inspiration needs a mindset that is open to new ideas. Moreover, inspiration that is built around a mindset pushes you to think differently. Attaining to be perfect will not help here as one will not dare to go out of the box and will be afraid of the consequences. When you are perfect, you cannot adapt to new situations. In today‚Äôs environment of complex challenges and rapid change, an adaptive mindset is what makes the real difference. An inspirational mindset will consider different problem solving settings to test and discover self-hidden abilities. Adaptability of the mindset will be considered a competitive advantage. An inspirational mindset has the ability to deal with unexpected demands, but may be in a totally different way, i.e. out of the norm results. The outcomes can therefore be measured with a different yard stick.

If you study the mindset of those inspired in our society you will find that they are very proactive. This is because an inspirational mindset will sometimes need to have the ability to adopt new strategies faster than others, and will train people to have self-initiative and be self-driven. Minds are usually fixed with certain ideas, values, people, systems and institutions. During inspiration attitudes and behaviour start to be challenged due to new feelings or actions that are caused by this sense of inspirational energy. The mind at that moment reinterprets what has just been experienced as a way to adjust and then develop a new line of sight that can be taken into consideration into what comes next. Psychologist Jerome Bruner describes this situation as ‚Äúfiguring out how to use what you already know in order to go beyond what you already think‚Äù. An inspirational mindset therefore enables us to have greater focused mind abilities than others. This leads us to differentiate our ability in getting the most healthy and profitable investment on selected opportunities, time after time. Samuel Johnson in the seventeenth century realised the importance of the mindset in creating the difference in our life when he said ‚Äòthe chains of habit are generally too small to be felt, until they are too strong to be broken‚Äô.

Making our mindset ready to see the big picture of what we want to achieve in life requires that we blend our wisdom and experience with some philosophy, pedagogy and enabling inspiration techniques. Therefore, an open mindset will try to transmit our experience, develop it, apprentice it, and nurture it, in order to make the most suitable move. If the mind goes through these processes then it is capable of performing many instances of reverse thinking and/or reforms that are beyond our expectations. Even ‚ÄòQuality of Life‚Äô can be then be taught as part of a mindset pedagogy design to help establish an even more dedicated focus that can help to create the right inspiration. Using a case or problem challenge and ‚Äòexperiential learning‚Äô that use debates, peer to peer teachings and games can help also prepare our mindset for reality challenges that are expected in the turbulence of any economy. An inspiration economy mindset therefore consists of four main constructs, as per Figure (3-2) these are: the profile of abilities and experiences that help establish approaches to learning, self confidence that helps establish an integrated holistic mindset, attempts of frequencies and efforts relevant to perception of tasks and meaning, and the motivation and self-initiatives that create the sources of inspiration. Such a mindset enhances the quality of life and increases real life learning through inspiring people again and again, thus making our spirit ready to encounter the unknown (Buheji etl. al., 2014; Schwartzman, 2010).

3.9	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY VS. SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
One of the main challenges of an inspiration economy is the egoism that controls a lot of good social behaviours. One of the negative consequences of egoism is that it also leads to narrow-mindedness over time.¬†The observation of the current market setting leads societies to more of individualistic behaviour. For example, the more the environment is built around team-work the more individualistic behaviour will be limited and thus there is more chance of being inspired through interactions or actions. Thus it can be easier to adopt certain social values in an environment that promotes respect for example in the environment and thus it is easier to be inspired about sustainability based theories and practices. When we use social behaviours in a positive way and make them part of society‚Äôs norms we are actually building great commonalities between what our brain appreciates and understands. Social interaction can lead to better understanding that the right brain appreciates from humanities, arts and entrepreneurship, plus it leads to building bridges with left brain experiences and specialities. Therefore the integration of both brains leads to seeing the big picture and thus provides more opportunities for inspiration. Inspiration from a sociological point of view has economic implications even though it is found to enhance the personal legacy. Inspiration is not only about ‚Äòabilities to do‚Äô and ‚Äòdeliver business to‚Äô society, rather it is about the study and analysis of ‚Äòwhat is‚Äô that the individual or society or its organisations should know about and explore to deliver better. Thus inspiration happens by ‚Äòidentifying and evaluating opportunities‚Äô for improvement and then it is about ‚Äòwhat will be‚Äô. Inspiration depends on ‚Äúwhole-brain‚Äù studies that utilise the best of both right and leftbrain. Social studies, art and literature require the attributes of the right-brain, while other scientific thinking optimises the utilisation of the left-brain. Inspiration happens due to the integration between social creativity, artistry, intuition, emotions and fantasy along with different specialties and disciplines. In a study that was carried by Dr. Joel Katz and his team, of Harvard Medical School, groups of students were tested for the effect of whole brain utilisation in the outcome of their studies. Dr. Kartz and his team had a group of first and second-year medical students spend a little over half their weekly class time at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The classes and workshops were on art, and the remaining hours in a course lecture for physical diagnosis in the College of Medicine (Naghshineh et. al. 2008). The team of researchers created a control group that attended only medical lectures, but did not join in museum visits. At the end of the eightweek term, the students who had participated in the art classes made 38 percent more positive observations than the students in the control group. This study reminds us that inspiration intensity will be much better if it is used through utilisation of the whole brain feature that is optimised through socialisation techniques and the appreciation of humanities and fine art.

Therefore, it can be concluded that an inspiration economy can flourish in education systems that are design based on the optimisation of whole brain functions.

3.10	 SOCIAL INNOVATION AND THE INSPIRATION ECONOMY
Social innovation enhances clarity, pace of learning, enthusiasm and empathy, so does inspiration. In order for an economy to flourish it needs an open learning environment with clear outcomes. Social innovation requires constant renewed views towards the meaning of the survival of society and economic development. Therefore, social innovation is totally dependent on the ability of society or the organisation to establish divine goals that meet the overall development of cultural and/or community life. Social innovation does not consider ‚Äòwhat life is‚Äô, but ‚Äòwhat life should be‚Äô. Therefore, as a concept, ‚Äòsocial innovation‚Äô can help to develop all the necessary service economics to respond to people‚Äôs perceptions and expectations. Social Innovation can work in-depth to develop people‚Äôs general behaviours, thus promoting ‚Äòinspiration‚Äô through services. Through social innovation, we can bring together multi-functional activities to address customers‚Äô needs, such as designing the school around today‚Äôs students, or designing or reengineering hospitals around today‚Äôs patients‚Äô needs.

Hence, social innovation requires a comprehensive understanding about people‚Äôs behaviour, as today we are moving from customer satisfaction to customer delight, to customer inspiration. This innovation also leads to a spiritual and mental comparison that leads to optimising the benefits of opportunities. Inspiration reflects the level of reaction to any social innovation initiative. When people are confronted with any innovative solution or approach, they are usually inspired by its performance from the first impression and this stays as it functions. Thus overall effectiveness is turning out to be a source of inspiration in relevance to people‚Äôs realisation of services delivered and/ or the ability of sustaining these services. Time after time one can be inspired, for example, by the level of services given in Singapore Airport and Singapore Airlines as compared to other airports or airlines. One‚Äôs inspiration is not linked to the level of the service only, but to the ability to sustain this level for many years, with different people and different situations. Today many innovations in the service industry enhance and sustain the level of happiness and feeling of wellbeing. Acquiring enjoyment short or long term can trigger inspiration that gives a sense of service uniqueness and effectiveness. Social process developments have focused on the material culture of life for a long time, this has lead to the increase of societies focus on consumption as a measure of progress. Today, humanity is realising that life and happiness need variety not quantity of innovations that lead to natural enjoyment not artificial ones. In an inspiration based economy we will seek social innovation in order to create more sustained transformational change in less fortunate communities. An inspirational economy will address issues such as poverty, nutrition, health, water and sanitation, economic empowerment, access to financial services, and gender equity through social innovation (Urama and Acheampong, 2013). The inspiring contents that social innovative services bring to people with various behaviours are unpredictable, and thus raise the level of outcomes and influences on people‚Äôs living effectiveness. Social development will continue to develop as a result of people pursuing innovations towards better wellbeing. This creates an inspiring economic environment where inspiration will bring into people‚Äôs life more choices, thus people are able to see more opportunities and possibilities as they walk the path of life. The availability of innovation can bring more improvement to life style which later has a significant effect on human social activities.

Social innovation therefore requires large devotion to ignite another form of inspiration within oneself. Thus, by innovating a need can be enhanced with inspiration again, as life conditions and environments become more and more difficult and complex.

3.11	 INSPIRATION AND PRODUCTIVITY
Inspiration has been linked directly and indirectly for many years with job satisfaction and job performance (Patton, 2001). A positive mood, has been found in many studies to contribute to higher levels of productivity too. Happy and inspired employees are found to change jobs less and usually they are more cooperative and productive. Many organisation targets have inspired employees, since they can enhance the chances to have higher customer satisfaction. Inspiration can cause better productivity, especially in societies where people have more opportunities and choices. Productivity has been found to be related to the feeling of having more choices since it is found to enhance the individual‚Äôs reading, debating and ability to have synthesised reflections. Overall Productivity Effectiveness (OPE) is a productivity term known more by lean management practitioners‚Äô school than economics. OPE is used by experts to measure very competitive productivity that can be achieved in any project or initiative. OPE is the result of a formula that comes from the total multiplication of (Availability) √ó (Quality) √ó (Efficiency). Inspiration raises our ability to capture opportunities that quickly go unnoticed, or occur in areas of blind spots, in our life journey; and this raises our capacity to be available to gain or benefit from opportunities or even to create them. Quality needs precision and accuracy, besides the spirit of persistence. People once they are inspired can transform to being more persistent. As for efficiency, it requires proper resource management and a high awareness of cost, it is about doing things right. Inspired people do not have a differentiation when it comes to efficiency, but usually they learn from failures to be more efficient and cost-effective. OPE tackles the property of the services delivered, and thus measures the multi-functional effectiveness that reflect on people‚Äôs socio-economic needs or functional effectiveness. For instance, the effectiveness of the economic productivity of restaurants, in any country, can be measured either by classical thought, for its main functions, that is to provide a food service that ensures proper quality standards, as measured today in many developed countries; or OPE can be measured on the ability of a restaurant to provide a comprehensive hospitality service that brings joy for different cultural backgrounds. It is a totally different approach to productivity, but one has to admit that even though the second measure is more difficult, it is more enjoyable.

In an economy driven by people demand for happiness, or even to reach a level of inspiration; the availability and quality of production surely would enhance any organisation or any society to the better in overall productivity effectiveness. In such a high expectation economy, OPE would be measured as a way for ensuring a relatively stable and respectable comprehensive increase in capacity compared to demand, thus ensuring both society‚Äôs and the community‚Äôs behavioural development, as compared to or beyond socio-economic requirements. Being now in a knowledge based economy, social productivity and material cultural life, are more near to the human capital contribution and not only based on the essentials of life‚Äôs necessities such as food, clothing, housing and work. Thus is it easier to move towards an economy that uses the essence of our humanity and respects our co-existence. It is now easier to transform towards an economy that influences society to consider what ought-to-be carried out to achieve better welfare.

3.12	 INTERNATIONAL INSPIRATION ECONOMY PROGRAMME
For any programme to be international it needs the support of robust research and development. An inspiration economy is no exception. Thus, the future knowledge community is expected to focus more on exploring the nature of relationships between the brain, culture and the created environment that leads to economic inspirational activity.

Using¬†this framework in a programme that supports the principle of an inspiration economy means we need to utilize information about the life cycle of inspiring figures, societies, organisations and practices as a source for learning about the hidden values and traits that differentiates them from the rest. Internationally successful inspirational driven programmes that target economical or socioeconomical settings are spreading in many industries today and involve education, healthcare, crime prevention, environmental protection, human trafficking, sport and many other human welfare activities. One of the latest international inspiration economy based programmes was London‚Äôs 2012 sports programme which was delivered in partnership with UNICEF, UK Sport, Youth Sport Trust and the charity International Inspiration. It was developed from Lord Coe‚Äôs promise in 2005 to inspire a generation and was the first programme of its kind conceived and implemented by a host city. The UK International Inspiration programme came to a formal end in March 2014, but the success of the programme and the continuing work of the UK partners involved in sport for development has meant that it will continue to have an impact for years to come. The main learning from such an international inspiration programme is how one programme can impact the socio economy of the world. Even though this programme came to a formal end, in reality it created a resonance in the world for future generations and a wave in the socio economy; besides it showed how sport can be used as part of education and lifelong learning through activities that are delivered on the ground in a very practical way, in 21 countries and cultures. The international inspiration school partnerships have challenged children, their parents and the teachers, to look beyond their own borders, share their knowledge and experience, and learn from different cultures. Teachers and school children in this programme have managed to build friendships across thousands of miles, working together on exciting joint projects to learn new skills and find creative ways to use sport to benefit their school and the wider community.

3.13	 THE ECONOMICS OF INSPIRATION
Inspiration is a feeling felt when an individual or a group discover what they most love doing and therefore dedicate more time for doing it. With inspiration based economies, feelings of passion, love, abundance and most of all commitment to seeing success; all serve for a higher level of life satisfaction (Andrews & Withey, 1976).

The world is in need today for what enhances people‚Äôs life quality and creates harmonised and synergised communities that have the choice of variety, more than just quantity. All the wars and situations of today make us realise the importance of having socio-economic conditions that establish the spirit of diversity acceptance and respect for coexistence and resilience. Therefore, we are in need of rediscovering the best potential of our human and spiritual side. Inspiration is a turning point in one‚Äôs life and is involved in people‚Äôs contribution to the economy and society and is very focused. This turning point can be seen in our involvement and change in outlook, worldview, lifestyle, choices or fate and relationships we draw or execute. Inspired people become more biased towards beliefs and values based on what they believe through their critical analysis that focuses on both risks and resilience. Through inspiration one will feel self-conscious. Being self-conscious will lead to people being more inspired and they will be able to create a stronger and more compelling business and educational case. Leveraging champions, changing stakeholders‚Äô attitudes and sharing best practices will be the fuel that enhances an inspiration economy‚Äôs outcome. An inspiration economy will have practices that help to focus on shifting the mindset from working harder and faster to working selectively and smarter towards an outcome. It is a shift from an economy that depends on materialistic gains, as the main source of happiness, to an economy focused on inspirational gain that differentiates countries and human reserves and powers to achieve different outcomes including materialistic ones. It is the era of what is called common sense questions, such as: How can we expand things to come in my life? An inspiration economy offers a completely new way of thinking for building up the economy, doing business, and establishing human potential. It is a shift in defining what is ‚Äòvalue added‚Äô in life, in work and towards our societies. The outcome of such an economy will be the creation of wealth in different forms and in different countries; including those for the less fortunate today. This inspiration economy will depend more on the concept of influence than impact and the concept of ‚Äúcapacity vs. demand‚Äù than the concepts of ‚Äúsupply vs. demand‚Äù. Thus it is an economy that will have a paradox of inspiration related clusters that are going to be spreading throughout communities. This type of economy requires a shift in people‚Äôs behaviour and consumerism, with a shift in purchasing power, from what consumers ‚Äúwant‚Äù or ‚Äúneed‚Äù towards purchasing products and/or services that capture people‚Äôs potential. Inspiration will create an economy that can make people focus on life contributions and increasing their sense of belongingness.

Foundations & Principles of ‚ÄòWhat is an Inspiration Economy?‚Äô

An inspiration based economy creates natural, non-artificial masters of innovation and entrepreneurs in every discipline. The economy that inspiration requires pushes and motivates clusters that drive societies to be autonomous and where the majority of the people shift towards being independent or inter-dependent in creating success stories. Creating an Inspiration based economy will depend on the ability to visualize and the ability to determine the type of inspiration that creates differentiation for each person, society or country. The outcome of an inspiration based economy lets us come with another wave of knowing the purpose of life. This cultural transformation is very exciting and enhances overall life satisfaction, therefore enhancing the contribution from different members in the community, along with their values in relevance to integrity.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Foundations & Principles of ‚ÄòWhat is an Inspiration Economy?‚Äô

Since the economy is based on inspired people, it is expected to be more flexible and most probably more dynamic. Inspired people believe in what they practice. Their dynamic mode creates a unique behaviour that makes them, in certain times, very rigid and in other times more flexible and dynamic. These inner structures help to streamline inspired individual choices and they empower people and their community to be more creative. Having a sensitive feeling and high consciousness is one of the early experiences in an economy based on inspiration. Such a society will be expected to have a high ability to heal and live the concept of diversity management. People are inspired to the extent that they deliver an economy that depends on transcendence, self-actualization, self-esteem and high belongingness. The life of inspired people changes our way to answering questions of life, including our socioeconomic practices. It is a type of life that gives answers through role models and actions, instead of just verbal communication, and thus changes the shape of our life style. When we are inspired, we overcome our bad habits that constrain us from sustaining success. Thus over time we build ourselves around a life purpose that enables us to see the depth of our contributions. We become even more naturally motivated to innovative. Our contributions then become fun and engaging. These are the traits of the inspiration economy. Expressing and researching socio-economic thoughts and facts are very important to the stability of any country, besides it is a basic need for the satisfaction and development of societies. Actually, the behaviour of any society is totally stipulated to ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù of wellbeing, but sometimes these principles are lowered to be shallow and more materialistic. Through clear guidelines that lead to socio-economic practices people can consider ‚Äòwhat they should do‚Äô, ‚Äòwhat they can‚Äôt do‚Äô and ‚Äòhow do to it‚Äô. This is the kind of traditional thinking in traditional economies. Therefore, in such economies people seem to be tied and fixed on possibilities. Traditional design and thought economies cannot work suitably any more even with our today‚Äôs paradigm. Today, if we go to a restaurant we are not looking for buying food only, we are also looking for the service around it. What people first of all consider is not to allay one‚Äôs hunger and or get nourishment, but to taste the temporal flavour, to feel the environment and experience the attitude of service. This is a type of socio-economic service and product based business expected from people. It is a type of human feeling that is called ‚Äòbehavioural economy‚Äô and we call it here ‚ÄúInspiration Economy‚Äù as it leads to inspire people to do something good towards others.

The level of the service and product delivery that is linked to the level of enthusiasm and focus delivered, make it move from traditional economy to being an inspirational economy service. This will be a type of criteria and part of competitiveness evaluation. It explains why people sometimes go to buy a product and a service even though they probably have no use for them and vice versa, due to the feeling of being inspired by the product or the service, or both. To feel the shift towards such an economy, means we start to appreciate the environmental stimulation that is based on capitalising human feelings and/or potential. The economics of living mainly makes us react always to the realistic circumstance, and thus sometimes we tend to forget values as social responsibility. However, the right economic value should be around living targets such as making a sense of life contributions and creating better achievements to our communities or the world. An inspiration economy comes to support better living principles and behaviours. Therefore, IE focuses on carrying excessive thinking of choice that can lead to inspire people even to change their behaviours. The life of mankind varies constantly and develops forwards continuously. Our human life has shifted from hard work for food and clothing in an agricultural economic age towards more of intelligent smart works. Today we are calling for inspiration driven work. Mankind has entered another living development period, in which there is no fixed paradigm of living standards, but there is a competition to explore our intrinsic abilities so that people can enjoy life according to their level of inspiring emotions or contributions. This kind of a positive psychological economy is not affected easily by environmental conditions or timing, however it is affected by frequency of attempt. It is an economy that can produce a value added product/service and leads us to enjoy any moment anywhere. An inspiration economy will focus on practical education from environment and environmental protection to guide students to reasonable consumption with proper arrangements.

3.14	 YOUTH AND STUDENTS IN AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY
Studies show that we die slowly without inspiration. This is especially true when you see youths or students who live life without an eagerness to travel, discover, read, or participate in social work, or make major contributions to society.

Inspiration for students and the youth is highly essential in order to build the right selfesteem, and to avoid becoming slaves to aimless life goals. The youth of today and students have a major role to play in the coming inspiration based economy. Even though most of the youth and students until today have been trained for most of their education in logic, rationality and verifiability. Perseverance is another important attitude that we need to embed in future students. This is what Edison meant when he said that ‚Äúscience is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration‚Äù. Much inspiration happens through effective experimentation and demonstration that lead mostly to discovering new knowledge. The best engine for this ‚Äòexperimentation‚Äô and ‚Äòlearning by doing‚Äô practices are youths and students. This stage is usually referred to as the stage of ‚Äòobservation‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscovery‚Äô. Youths and students are the best age and group that have always the feeling and the need for achievement and self-discovery. If this age is really strategically utilised to the benefit of injecting a new spirit in the economy, they will be a source of new ideas that feed inspiration into the economy. Students and youths can experience life problems that can be solved using gained knowledge which creates another source of endeavour and more focused life contributions.

Foundations & Principles of ‚ÄòWhat is an Inspiration Economy?‚Äô

By building the spirit of inquiry in students we can build a citizen with a high reliability and focused contribution to the economy. Students also can enhance their interpersonal relationship skills, values, ethical and moral norms through collective team work experimentation and interpretation of scientific work. Students need to experience challenges and learn how to overcome them. Inspiration needs proper strategies that make a consistent challenge to change attitudes and to work holistically with a team spirit based irrespective of age, caste, creed, religion, etc. For this inspiration to occur, small steps in learning and education will help to push students to think out of the box, thus developing an ability that can imagine, analyse and try alternatives. Inspiration needs students and youths who use the power of observation while controlling fear and experimenting with different subjects. Students and youths need to be inspired through more opportunity for travelling, attending national and international conferences, conducting special training programmes, visiting best practices, working with or for research centres, working in cross-functional teams, understanding customers‚Äô demands and measuring society‚Äôs needs.

3.15	 FRAMEWORK OF AN INSPIRATION DRIVEN ECONOMY
Most of the best developed countries and leading emerging economies have a framework that creates inspiration for society today. However, the world still needs a framework that will be established on the basis of social and cultural abundance that will increase the dynamics of the economy if properly utilised. A concrete and deeper inspiration driven economy framework will be based on a series of inputs that help to create its existence, such as leadership, frequency of inspiration, prerequisites and processes of inspiration. The inspiration economy framework will be expected to have outputs creating a more innovative and learning organisation. Social crisis and society diseases can be proactively eliminated, if we establish a practical framework that targets to create stability for people‚Äôs life, through discovering themselves. Since we are targeting a psychology based economy that focuses on better human affairs, the framework needs to show how life is rich and colourful with feelings. This will help stimulate emotions which lead to better focused motivated productivity. It is a framework that targets to make people consistently inspired to overcome the difficulty of living choices. This type of framework will lead to more choices and thus a move towards a fair quality of life which leads to behaviours that optimise time and energies.

Consequently, the framework of an inspiration economy will focus on the level of community participation, with a work life balance and targeting an impact on the environment. For inspiration to occur, as per the framework, it will need to go through stages of fussiness and search for truth, and then a stage of challenges, and a stage of sustenance. It is a framework that will increase our diversity, resilience, persistence, spirit of agility and passion based commitments. When we have a framework that satisfies basic living needs, people will turn to look for higher demands. People, in such a framework, will tend to look more for unity, for reaching out, and for understanding the within. Such a framework will be totally independent in what people aim to do and leave as a legacy. It is a type of framework that will be based on the extension of thought and ‚Äòinfluencing without power‚Äô. The framework will ensure that all attempts to change, or real contributions towards overcoming human challenges or enhancement of social harmony, are really appreciated and celebrated.

4	UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN ‚ÄòECONOMY AND PSYCHOLOGY‚Äô
4.1	 ECONOMICS AND PSYCHOLOGY
Frey and Benz, of the University of Zurich, carried out research on modern economics and psychology to establish the level of continuity of this relationship and found that it is still swings towards supporting human co-existence and selective interaction, which are practices appreciated today more than ever. However, modern economics still carries behavioural models which disregard human psychological factors. Therefore, today we see a rise in and demand for what is called ‚Äúhomo oeconomicus‚Äù, which leads humans to take decisions based on rational and emotionless behaviour based on cost effectiveness and not based on the level of inspiration. Without the positive emotions and feelings in the decision making process today we would be consuming higher degrees of rationality that are limited by self-control problems, and thus would be solely based on actions guided by self-interest and non-resilience. In today reality, almost every society use economic approach to materialist controlled human behaviour has been successfully applied to almost every society, every sector and every process which are today together called ‚Äúeconomic imperialism‚Äù. This economic approach has been linked to other supplemental concepts such as the ‚ÄúLaw of Economics‚Äù, or ‚ÄúFamily Economics‚Äù; however they seem to be far from being really well-balanced. Psychological considerations in economics were lost in the last two centuries. However, with the spread of positive psychology and good best practices today, new important insights for psychology and other social sciences are leading to the fast development of a new field of ‚ÄúBehavioural Economics‚Äù. It is a concept that supports the hypothesis that behaviour can systematically deviate from a fully rational model of decision making and from the current economic approaches resulting from bounded self-interest. Actually, as per ‚ÄòBehavioural Economics‚Äô individuals are found to behave in a non-selfish way in many situations.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Understanding the relations between ‚ÄòEconomy and Psychology‚Äô

Within today‚Äôs mainstream economics, the relationship between economics and psychology can best be described as imperialistic on the part of economics. A lot of classical economists in the 18th and 19th century carefully considered psychological reasoning when debating preferences and beliefs. Several developments in economic science after 1930 have led to a loss of psychological content (Lewin 1996). This can best be shown with the concept of utility. Using the concept of utility as an illustration is also useful because the assumption that individuals maximise expected utility is at the core of neoclassical theory. Burns et. la. (1968) shown based on the work of Betham how pleasures and pains results in both tangible and intangible sense of pleasure, wealth, power, expectation and relief. After World War II, these completely materialistic dry views became even enshrined in research and textbooks as part of the mainstream ‚ÄúNew Welfare Economics‚Äù. However, if one studies the success of the switch from ‚Äòmeasurable utility‚Äô to ‚Äòpreference ordinal utility‚Äô, which supported the concept of consumer indifference and represented the states of minds, such as how much satisfaction or pleasure a good yields, are indeed inherently difficult to measure (Hicks, 1934; Allen, 1934). Most of the traditional economic theories are built, till today, around behavioural assumptions of rational and selfish behaviours in relevance to markets only (Becker und Murphy, 2000; Frey, 1999; Becker, 1996). Therefore, with such a limitation of current traditional theories, human action in relevance to the market can be due causality due to having Incentives based behaviours, or high personal accountability and/or due to changes in human behaviour, as per Shaver (2015). Also, Shaver (2015) seen that observation abilities, the ability to measure or having self-initiative can be part of these causalities.

4.2	 BRAIN INSPIRATIONAL ACTIVITIES
Inspiration activities are sources of influencing our brains towards the bright ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moments and/or ideas, whatever the type of work or activity we do. While inspiration does not necessarily come from a process you can control entirely, there are ways to enable and encourage your brain to have a greater ability to capture more opportunities and create more brain inspirational moments! Through the mechanism of neuroplasticity, our brain simply continues to form new connections and neural pathways between two ideas and more. The brain then restructures itself to accommodate new inspirational thoughts and processes. Because our brain‚Äôs memory is more like plastic we can form more creative or inspirational thoughts. When we are focused, or alert, and/or attentive to an inspirational idea, our brains even exhibit high levels of¬†‚Äúbeta‚Äù waves. These ‚Äúbeta‚Äù waves help to empower the brain for tasks we have already learned and to let us see how we can get these tasks executed. The more our brain is able to create new connections, the more plastic our brain is, the more it is easier to generate those ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moments.

Boosting brain neuroplasticity can enhance our inspiration ability. There are certain activities that inspire the brain. Inspiration of the brain can come from exercising what facilitates neuroplasticity of certain brain structures and reading which can help¬† build new neural connections in our brain. Meditation also creates a wide array of positive effects on the brain, including decreasing the level of anxiety, increasing creativity and compassion, and improving memory abilities. Recent studies show that brain neuroplasticity is even affected by games that can actually lead to an increase in grey matter. Research also shows that in order to increase the neuroplasticity of our brain, we need to get consistent opportunities to exercise it through challenges (Davidson, 2012). Our creative inspirational ideas come from activities such as projects. If our brain is in a blank slate, it will be very difficult to generate great ideas. Researchers say that our brain at that stage will not only empty, but directionless, aimless, and frustrating. This means if we have specific goals that we need to accomplish, there is a need to go ahead and test these in the field in order to get as much feedback on as one can, before putting them into realised committed implementation. If you have to create something with more focus,¬†first you need to explore your thoughts or what you considered for some time as bad or impossible ideas. You always need something to put into your brain to obtain feelings and to get it into focus. This gives you something to process when you get to those ‚Äúalpha‚Äù and ‚Äútheta‚Äù states. Identifying and knowing also your idea pools can help your brain to get focused and thus ready for inspirational activities. If you are doing some creative work, it helps to look at similar work before you get started. Whatever work it is that you do, there is¬†never a reason to lack inspiration, as there are many sources for igniting this inspiration today, more than ever before. Most important you need to put your brain into an activity before you expect it to be inspired.

4.3	 THE FEELING ECONOMY
The feeling economy addresses how society or organisations seek to create change or introduce an innovation, while respecting the personal feelings of the concerned parties. The feeling economy focuses on positive psychology and not on large scale production and pays attention to utilising positive feelings such as having people fully engaged in the change of their life or their community, as the foundation of the differentiation of this economy. The feeling economy tries not to undermine the current economy and its effect on people‚Äôs lifestyle, but to enhance it through adding feelings as another added value to current economic activities. The feeling economy focuses on handling personal impressions that help in enhancing living effectiveness.

The feeling economy pays attention inter-personal relationships and establishing better social harmony. The world needs such an economy that absorbs the diversity differences. The feeling economy focuses on how to enrich people‚Äôs lives to attract more people‚Äôs affection rather than just focusing on the general growth of society. In all economies consistent inner demands of social developments are achieved through focused conciseness and efficiency. Today with the transformation of cultures and another level of civilisation‚Äôs feelings, enjoyment, novelty, and uniqueness of cultural atmosphere are becoming variables for the next economy. Organisations in this type of economy, including ones in education, healthcare, or even media will be measured by their ability to move feelings and to make people carry on with logical performance. The good thing about the feeling economy is that supports human endeavour to search for positive feelings and thus help to remain productive. Innovation, for example, requires that we have a feeling that supports our mental enquiry to search or funnel an idea. Economics therefore needs to pay attention to the feeling economy, not only the materialist or physical life concerns, but to feelings that ease life complexities while strengthening resilience.

The feeling economy therefore addresses people‚Äôs livelihood needs, the meaning of overall living and how it is designed for use. The feeling economy helps to improve the overall performance of human thinking, emotions and living requirements.

4.4	 HAPPINESS AND INSPIRATION
Another type of economy that depends on psychology is the happiness economy. Happiness, as per Aristotle, carries the meaning and purpose of life. Aristotle said that the whole aim of life comes with happiness and without happiness we would witness an end of human existence even though physically alive. Here is where inspiration meets happiness. The world today has a clear gap in appreciating the value and returns on the process of striving towards goals, rather than just achieving goals. A consistency in striving towards goals is found to be crucial for continuity of the sources of inspiration and the feeling of happiness. This in itself is a natural human resource motivator. Happiness itself is considered to be a source of inspiration because it is about the experience we go through when we climb towards the peak of our goals. Inspiration coincides with happiness here, since it helps in building the self-realisation of abilities and thus enables us to take accurate decisions (Sheldon and Houser-Marco, 2001). Therefore, happiness is becoming a science in itself. Recently, the University of Illinois‚Äô positive psychologist Edward Diener and his team studied what makes people happy, while fulfilling their life goals. The Diener studies led to more exploration of why the economic routes to happiness are not linked to endless growth, since happiness resides in reaching values that are closer to our hearts. The Himalayan nation of Bhutan (with a population: less than 800,000) understood the importance of happiness in feeling general well-being, therefore the Bhutan government established a Gross National Happiness (GNH) index. The GNH index has helped the Bhutan government to formulate a basis for its policy decisions in relevance to happiness factors such as family and community bonding, spirituality, education, compatibility with nature and good physical health. After years of primary research, the Bhutanese have identified nine domains for assessing happiness: psychological well-being, physical health, time use (worklife balance), community vitality and social connection, education, cultural preservation and diversity, environmental sustainability, good governance and material well-being. Today and since 2004, through an annual International Conference on Gross National Happiness held in Bhutan, many governments and thought leaders are trying to replicate the Bhutan experience to improve their country‚Äôs health and quality of life. As of 2011, a nonbinding United¬†Nations resolution is set to encourage the member countries to shift towards measuring their health and happiness,¬†besides their current wealth measurements.

4.5	 ECONOMY OF LIFE SATISFACTION
Life satisfaction has been, and would still be, the main purpose of any economic and socioeconomic theory. To improve our life satisfaction we need to improve our well-being and understand the purpose of happiness and the role and relation of feelings within our economic status. In order to come to a balance of all of these types of economies that are important to community life satisfaction, one needs to apply ‚Äòpull thinking‚Äô not ‚Äòpush thinking‚Äô; where we need to focus on ‚Äòour social connections‚Äô and ‚Äòour overall contributions‚Äô and not only ‚Äòhow much we make‚Äô, in order to have a more resource free satisfied life. The way we visualise and balance our life will need to be analysed more. Choosing to live with less things and lighter debt supports the pull thinking approach, where we should use less resources to achieve bigger goals, the goals should not be just a better life with more income, but more time ability to contribute, with balanced income and lower stress that leads to a better ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô. The world today calls for an economy that creates better ‚Äòlife satisfaction‚Äô for ourselves, our families and our societies through real economic well-being practices. The economics of life satisfaction is therefore based on genuine wealth and also perishable materialistic wealth. This means we need a profound economics grounded in the well-being of the people. There are today many transition based programmes in leading countries with targets to create a vibrant society that is built on the grassroots which seek to build community resilience in the face of socio-economic challenges. Developing countries that move toward a non-perishable innovative economy are focusing on improving a different life satisfaction through enhancing the well-being of society. The realisation of the importance of life satisfaction attitudes and behaviours are gradually preparing an economy that is based on values beyond materialistic gains. This is especially noticeable today with the rising number of middle class global citizens. A life satisfaction economy therefore, is not about the concerns of wealth, rather it is more about the balances between the necessities, conveniences, luxuries, with the best fit amount of contributions and self-realisation. It is beyond uncertainty¬†and¬†bounded rationality¬†during the process of economic decisions.

4.6	 INSPIRATION AND PSYCHOLOGY
Economics is considered to be an imperialistic science, by its critics, due to the development towards a fully rational model of economic decision-making. Bruno Frey and Matthias Benz undertook a study in 2002 about how economies transfer from Imperialism to Inspiration. The study covers inspiration in relation to interaction between economics and psychology. Today, there is a very vibrant and dynamic relationship between economics and psychology. While economics was once imperialistic, it has become a science inspired by psychological insights.

The economics of today is more about the power of creating money plus other relevant issues. However, the power to create money no longer resides with us, but rather is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few, whether these few are represented by mega global companies, or multi-billionaires, or private banks. Besides this, money today is no longer backed by anything real, even though it is a medium of exchange; it has no inherent value. It is not real or tied to anything of real substance or genuine wealth. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is also another measure that is used to determine a country‚Äôs competitiveness. Latest studies show that GDP is not a good measure of a country‚Äôs quality of life, happiness and even real development. Governments are realising more and more that they need to design their socio-economic path around healthy relationships, meaningful jobs and trusting work places that make people more inspired and hopefully happy. Once people have met most of their basic material needs for life, money does not translate into either more objective or subjective well-being or happiness. If you are earning $50,000 and you are having the same rise every year this does not mean you would be more inspired or even happier, unless it is an inspiring working environment. According to Yale University professor, Robert Lane, the correlation between income and happiness is close to zero.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Understanding the relations between ‚ÄòEconomy and Psychology‚Äô

Modern economics and psychology are both sciences of human behaviour. Although they have a common theme, their relationship still swings between pure ‚Äòco-existence‚Äô and ‚Äòselective interaction‚Äô. Starting from the analysis of human behaviour in markets, modern economics has developed a behavioural model which disregards psychological factors almost completely. Behavioural economics concerns modern theories that support the principles of an inspiration economy as it incorporates psychological aspects into the model of human behaviour. A traditional economic approach never the less has many limitations that result from the bounded rationality of individuals. On the other hand experimental economics has shown that pro-social preferences can play a major role in human behaviour. Individuals once they are inspired, often follow social norms, like fairness or reciprocity. However, current economic approaches do not take into account intrinsic motivations in relevance to self-image. Inspiration creates non-selfish behaviour that helps to overcome a sense of failure. Inspiration has received little theoretical or empirical attention within psychology (Thrash and Elliot, 2003). We are inspired when we achieve insights that come out of feeling of necessity or a passion. We are inspired when a mentor or role model reveals new possibilities that cannot be recognized by the current level of thought. We get excited when see a beauty, truth, or pursue a goal more important than the current one occupying our minds. Many people have linked this excitement to inspiration since it has been narrowly thought of as it is limited to religions or creativity. Inspiration is seen as an evoked or initiated activity that happens directly after an activity and sometimes arises without apparent causes. Inspiration involves transcendence of the ordinary preoccupations or limitations of the human agency (Hart, 1998). The stimulation of inspiration can be evoked by an idea, a vision, role model, event, knowledge, individuals, organisations, society and even a country. With such inspiration we will discover what is possible within oneself and our life journey mission and even our legacy in this world. Distraction is the greatest form of inspiration, because when we are distracted we are more prone to think outside of the problem. Overcoming distraction or disruption can lead to an inspiration that leads into something real and tangible. Many scientists create an intentional psychological interference with obstacles for students to stimulate their ability to learn beyond the traditional environment.¬†

Allport and Odbert (1936) classified inspiration psychology as a temporary state that leads to an inspirational state as a social evaluation. However, we prefer to see inspiration as an evolving enhancement that leads to hyper-activation and the feeling of being overtaken (Davitz, 1969). With inspiration self-motivation is activated, and a ‚Äòfeeling of being overtaken‚Äô is transcended, and more clarity comes out of fuzziness which occurs gradually.

4.7	 INSPIRATION AND THE ECONOMICS OF PERFECTION
Perfection has been closely tied in with the new economy. The Japanese understood this after the World War Two when they used the concepts of ‚ÄúKaizen‚Äù and ‚ÄúKanzen‚Äù to resemble continual improvement and striving towards perfection. Many other societies or organisations take pride about being perfect in design and delivery, such as the Swiss and the Austrians. However, few researchers and even practitioners have started to see that sometimes perfection keeps us from reaching our highest potential or being able to discover many opportunities. If we can constantly do and perform everything perfectly, we may over time think we are effective and efficient, thus there is a need to keep the status quo. But, sometimes it is imperfect performances that demonstrate greatest potential or carry best lifetime opportunities or even come up with innovative solutions that create a realised breakthrough thus moving the world economy forward. An inspiration economy will not easily come with perfectionism; because when you are perfect, you do not take risks, while an inspiration economy is driven by calculated risk taking based on the ability to foresee coming opportunities. Driving your way towards inspiration means you need to be persistent to try or even repeat failures even in times and conditions of uncertainty. If you ask those who have inspired us most of them would tell you that without risks they would not have managed to develop and achieve as much influence. Most of the time inspiration needs unstructured thinking and practices that might not go ‚Äòby the book‚Äô, and this is not suitable for a perfection based economics. Being a source of inspiration you need to have a lot of imagination and a repetitive spirit and most of the time a dynamically based visionary leader. Following specific guidelines does not give you or your ideas room to manoeuvre. This is surely what you will hear from those who have managed to create a change in their life. Inspiration depends on being somewhat natural or operating in a suitable relaxing mode. When you feel you are perfect, then you may be becoming stagnant and might not develop. Being or attaining perfection means you are trying to avoid pain, however pain is found to be a real source of trying to discover or enhancing one‚Äôs capacity. By living and doing everything exactly right, you are really giving up on freeing yourself from current blind spots that shield most beauty around you.

Studies show, however, that having perfectionism is not always bad, as inspiration in history has occurred by people or groups in society who were particular about ‚Äòwhat to do‚Äô and not ‚Äòhow much to do‚Äô. Their inspiration came from ‚Äòpull thinking‚Äô and not ‚Äòpush thinking‚Äô. When you work to inspire yourself and your world you do not mind doing the same thing again and again, since this will lead you to boosting your ability to learn which will supersede perfectionism. Therefore, you choose the ‚Äòroad less travelled‚Äô and even put yourself in uncomfortable situations, sometime intentionally; to trigger your conscious reinvention.

4.8	 INSPIRATION AND THE ECONOMICS OF WELLBEING
Self-esteem has been the most important socio-economic factor for all economics theories throughout history. No culture would be economically stable and sustainable without selfesteem. Any success you see today from any culture, i.e. Japanese, German, American, etc, can be related to the self-esteem of this culture. The economics of well-being is built on selfesteem simply because it leads to stronger immune systems, a better cardiovascular system, and better quality of life principles and practices.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Understanding the relations between ‚ÄòEconomy and Psychology‚Äô

Inspiration, or more precisely the lack of it, is found, for example, to create a fear into many students when faced with an assignment or test, a blank sheet of paper and a ticking clock. However, usually under the right pressure our insights or ideas suddenly flow too. The economics of wellbeing is derived from a combination of genetic inheritance, intentional activity and life circumstances. The message of this economy is that we can create our wellbeing and not necessarily need to be dependent on extrinsic sources. In 2010, Gallup produced a report called ‚ÄòHealth ways‚Äô that ranked the happiest world countries to be Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden followed by the Netherlands. The report was shocking as many countries with leading economies had their wellbeing economies to be rated low. For example, the USA wellbeing economy came to be 11th, even though it is ranked among the leading economically stable countries. When we see this in the lens of the wellbeing, we see that it is ranked as one of lower middle countries, since a capitalist economy leads to a life and status of wellbeing that has many possibilities for sadness, anger, anxiety and stress. As Thrash et. al. (2010) showed, experiences of inspiration can promote wellbeing. An inspiring video, reviewing stories of extraordinary talents and performance, historical figures, game changers; can all help to create a sense of wellbeing. Wellbeing is found to be linked to the creation of a positive affect, in life satisfaction. Therefore, such status leads to a feeling of empowerment and vitality, besides self-actualization. The economics of wellbeing is therefore a collection of many senses that boost the economy and create focused ‚Äòpull actions‚Äô towards an innovative driven community. Leading governments and world class organisations, today, adopt and appreciate more and the economic effect of ‚Äòwell being at work‚Äô. For example, this is seen clearly in the UK case in the recent Cameron Government. Studies show that once people‚Äôs wellbeing is assured they use their economic resources to pursue their own goals. Therefore, studies show that it is better if people are allowed to address the type of wellbeing preferences they would like in order to ensure social and political stability. Both industrial and information based economies focus on economic prosperity that leads to human‚Äôs and society‚Äôs wellbeing. Today, people are looking for something else to build up their wellbeing that involves quality of life and inspiration. Some also rank happiness as a life goal, however as one could conclude happiness needs a sustained and balanced life and the feeling of recognition and renewal. So GDP based on materialistic means is totally acquainted with real human needs. It is actually an artificial implant established since the industrial revolution. Our nature is more acquainted with the economics that preserves human well-being and this is the real measure of human prosperity (Seligman, 2004).

4.9	 FEELINGS OF INSPIRING OTHERS
Inspiration is ‚Äúthe‚Äù most important tool you can equip someone you love and care about with during their life journey. Since inspiration is about belief that turns into love and messages of trust. Inspiring others means you open their minds, hearts, spirit and the rest of their body senses for their ability to achieve what was thought to be impossible. Being able to make time in your life to inspire others and not only help them is the future of an inspiration economy. Inspirational moments are like dreams in your mind that create powerful feelings. Being able to give or transform inspiration to others is the most powerful currency we can share or deal with. The Prophet of Islam ‚ÄòMohamed‚Äô is quoted saying repeatedly about the importance of the feeling of inspiring others, to the extent he described the feeling of managing to inspire others as better than the rare red type of Arabian camel species in the dissert, or on another occasion he said ‚Äúit is better than having a fortune of the whole world!‚Äù I am sure we will come across many similar sayings from those who have experienced inspiring others. It is really an indescribable feeling. What the prophet ‚ÄòMohamed‚Äô visualised is what we know as a reality, if you forget to inspire others, you will forget to inspire yourself and if you forget to inspire yourself, you will forget to live and contribute to your living. For those who inspire others it becomes a way of life, the day they go back home and relax it is an unhappy day for them. A person who died recently could not sit back and relax at home, he used to come back home just to see his family and ensure their living and went back again to continue relief missions in Africa or Asia. When telling him how much he needed to be around his family, he replied ‚ÄòI might have lost to make my family more happy than what they are, but I can‚Äôt miss the feeling of inspiration in the prinking eyes of those we help to carry on with new hope in their life every day‚Äô. One really would appreciate these feelings, since it is really as if you are giving someone life, even within limited powers. Thus the learning here is that we need to inspire others without worrying about limitations. There is a need to inspire others to the extent that makes them trust and believe in themselves again. By inspirig then there is more legacy around, for a longer time. There is no clarity concerning the feelings you carry about those who have inspired you in life, to a level never taken to before and may be would never be taken to again. Really if you think about it, you will really wish to do something for those who have caused this inspiration to compensate them for that gift that is worth millions to you, to date, in your memories.

As long as there is a feeling of inspiring others, the world always has creative and competitive development. The issues that differentiate us in the memory of others, even for those who we did not see or even will not know, even after we die; is about how we continue to inspire these people to a higher level? There are, unfortunately, not too many different ways of inspiration discovered yet, as all humanity sustained inspiration sources show it depends on constant evolution and renewed interpretation. This means we need to work like gardeners, where every plant needs to be watered or fertilized, until the weeds are weathered and even given some sun light. Inspiring others can be considered the dream transportation cart. Through inspiring others we can take them to somewhere near to their dreams, or make them feel the need to have new dreams, or make them realise that their dreams can come true! It is difficult to imagine a currency, fortune or a business that would do all this together. This the economic power of inspiring others. It is again what we call ‚Äòinfluencing without power‚Äô. The power to inspire others is exactly the power that Ghandi and Mandela managed to acquire to make dreams come true for Indians and South Africans and it is the same power that each of us can have. It is difficult to sustain this power, but it can be with practice and the most important it is free, yet it is not owned by the government. We believe it to be the power that differentiates the market and sets conditions and future social status.

4.10	 INSPIRATION VS. ESTABLISHED CONCEPTS
Life today is either ‚Äòa series of concepts‚Äô or ‚Äòtests for concepts‚Äô. If one reviews all the popular concepts of life and especially those of relevance to inspiration we cannot have Maslow‚Äôs Pyramid of motivational behaviour unnoticed. Abraham Maslow, used his observation as a psychologist to understand why a large number of children were unable to achieve their potential. Maslow noticed that human beings have a variety of needs, like physiological needs (food, water, oxygen, body temperature, etc.); then psychological needs as safety (house, job, retirement plan, etc.); belonging needs (family, community, groups, friends, etc.); esteem needs (fame, recognition, glory, dignity, etc.) and most important ‚Äòbeing needs‚Äô (be all that you can be). All of them together create a motivated human being. In relevance to testing and evaluating inspiration related concepts also one cannot go without coming across the ‚ÄòJean Piaget‚Äô test of intelligence. Piaget found that certain people were unable to deal with certain types of questions that demanded logical thinking. Piaget believed that these types of people might not have achieved all the four distinct stages that are related to cognitive and inspiration development, these are: sensory motor development, preoperational development, concrete operational development and formal operational development. Inspiration has not been studied or tested for both concepts and this can be seen clearly even in the above popular references. Inspiration actually is a concept and a test in itself. Without inspiration, as a concept, we cannot create and/or measure a human being who accountable for inspirational deeds and legacy.

4.11	 HORMONES OF INSPIRATION
Inspiration involves activities that motivate the whole brain. Neurotransmitters such as dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenalin play an important role in creating the senses we feel through the brain, once we have the ‚Äúsparks‚Äù of inspiration. Through these senses, the brain which is a strange mechanism is connected to what we do or are stimulated by. Depending on our reactions to these types of doings, we also have different sources of excitement and inspiration.

One of the most important mechanisms of the brain is how hormones are produced due to internal or external excitements. Introversion and extroversion is about how our brains recharge. For example, for people with extrovert brains, they respond more strongly when a gamble pays off. Part of this is simply genetic, but it is partly¬†the difference of their dopamine systems,¬†as well due to the stronger response happening in two crucial brain regions as shown in Figure (4-2). The nucleus acumens in the brain is the part that manages the dopamine system, which affects how we learn, and is generally known for motivating us to search for rewards. The difference in the dopamine system in the extrovert‚Äôs brain tends to push them towards seeking out novelty, taking risks and enjoying unfamiliar or surprising situations more than others. The amygdale of the brain is the part responsible for processing emotional stimuli, which gives extroverts that rush of excitement when they try something highly stimulating which might overwhelm an introvert. More research¬†has actually shown that the difference comes from how introverts and extroverts process stimuli. That is, the stimulation coming into our brains is processed differently depending on your personality. For extroverts, the pathway is much shorter. It runs through an area where taste, touch, visual and auditory sensory processing takes place. For introverts, stimuli runs through a long, complicated pathway in areas of the brain associated with remembering, planning and solving problems. The mechanism of the brain is even stranger with people who make mistakes than those who do not! Making mistakes actually makes us¬†more likeable, due to something called the Pratfall Effect. Those who do not make mistakes are less likeable than those who commit the occasional mistakes. Mistakes draw us closer to people, as they make us look like normal humans, while perfection creates distance between us and typical humans. This is a well observed fact that should increase our inspirational attempts without fear. In a test, undertaken by psychologist Elliot Aronson, participants were asked to listen to recordings of people answering a quiz. Select recordings included the sound of the person knocking over a cup of coffee. When participants were asked to rate the quizzers on likeability, the coffee-spill group came out on top. So this is why we tend to dislike people who seem perfect!

Once hormones are released we can admit emotions. Emotions here create inspiration waves. This pushes to a type of response. Just like waves of the ocean, people feel their emotional response rise and fall all the time. Being emotional is a very natural phenomenon in the body, but what is important is how to process it and use towards the benefit of ourselves and society. When neurotransmitters secrete, information is transferred in the brain between the brain lobes and cortex areas thus creating more opportunity for inspiration. Serotonin is one of the strong neurotransmitters that produce positive emotions. As a hormone, Serotonin¬†increases when we are creative and decreases when we are stressed. When serotonin secretes less than normal levels, people can have trouble managing stress and become easily angry or depressed thus missing lots of inspirational moments.

One of the ways to manage Serotonin is by having a relaxed focus on the environment or even having meditation that makes us feel comfortable, peaceful and joyful. Many types of meditation, and similar practices, are used, more and more today to produce a high level of inspiration or prepare our brains for being inspired, before or after, positive hormone excitement. Many people use motivation to improve their ability to focus and stay calm throughout the day, but it is found also to help them in managing anxiety. Less anxiety is found to be related to any type of meditation or prayer where we try to deepen what we have, and it turns out this is because¬†we are actually loosening the connections of particular neural pathways. This sounds bad, but it is not. What happens without meditation is that there is a section of our brains called the medial prefrontal cortex. This cortex part processes information relating to ourselves and our experiences. When we experience a scary or upsetting situation, a strong reaction is triggered in our prefrontal cortex, making us feel scared and under attack. With meditation anxiety and agitation will decrease within just 20 minutes. Consistent inspiration through hormones requires a continuous flow of information that causes a different excitement in different ways. When our brains receive different excitements of information, they are usually decoded and reorganized and then presented to our suitable lobes or areas to trigger proper reaction. Even this information might go to different areas of the brain thus creating our perception. Figure (4-1) shows the different areas of the brain that are relevant to our excitements and hormone production. ch ap te r four

When we receive a lot of new information, it takes our brains a while to process it all. The longer this processing takes,¬†the longer that period of time feels. When we are in life-threatening situations, for instance,¬†we feel the time of this fear as long, because we record more of the experience. Life-threatening or enjoyable music or news experiences make us pay attention, with superhuman powers of perception. The same thing happens when we hear enjoyable music, because¬†a greater attention leads to perception of a longer period of time. Conversely, if your brain¬†does not have to process a lot of new information, time seems to move faster, so the same amount of time will actually feel shorter than it would otherwise. This happens when you take in a lot of information that is familiar, because you have processed it before. Your brain does not have to work very hard, so it processes time faster. Gherlin is another hormone that plays a good role in inspiration. When Gherlin reduces¬†it help us to become more relaxed. Ghrelin is released when we become hungry and that is why fasting or mild eating practices or just eating according to our body‚Äôs real needs are relevant to most of those inspired and still inspiring the world. Oxytocin is another inspiration source hormone that comes with the feeling of love and trust. Oxytocin can be produced by hugging or touching or other types of affectionate physical contact. In many global organisations they target their people who are trusted in whatever they do and they are loved for their identity and not only for their contributions. What these companies are actually doing is that they are triggering and directing the best inspirational moments to the company. Therefore, we can conclude that the mechanism of the brain shows that it is motivated, manipulated, stimulated and communicated towards being inspired by the excitements of the hormones involved. The studies show that the more the brain waits for something the more it will appreciate it when it finally arrives. Our brains are excited for good things that are worth waiting and fighting for.

4.12	 ECONOMIC APPROACHES AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
Inspired people usually ‚Äòpull‚Äô their society‚Äôs thinking to contribute in different ways. Thus society, in turn, keeps those inspiring individuals under a focal lens and monitors their failures and opportunities, when they work outside the norms.

In Social Psychology, the significance of the economic approach is that it helps to give clear predictions for human or society behaviour. The economic approaches are then compared to different hypotheses of predicting how individuals behave in such a way as to maximise their own productivity (Ajzen 1988). Such social attitudes are the central determinants of behaviour related economy. It is taken as being self-evident that a tendency towards positive judgement is followed by corresponding behaviour that affects directly or indirectly our socio-economic decisions. These attitudes are very important to an inspirational based economy. The influence of social attitudes can be seen when citizens are inspired to contribute to change their level of involvement or to use their power to buy or boycott goods. These attitudes directly affect the economy. This can be seen even in our daily practices, where you will find people spread and share products or services that inspired them.

Economists do not expect that behaviour can be predicted on the basis of preferences. Thus, we need to embed psychological practices so that we enhance related socio-economic attitudes in our societies. Some economists, in particular Stigler and Becker (1977), have argued that changes in human behaviour are relevant to changes in restrictions. It is found that these restrictions enhance our ability to contribute. Changes in preferences or alternatives appear to be related to changes in behaviour. There are many examples of how social psychology defines economic approaches towards life situations during time with our families, school, community, work, or even travelling with our friends (Becker and Murphy, 2000; Freeman, 1999; Frey,1999; Lannacone, 1998; Becker and Murphy 1988). With an inspiration based economy our positive behaviour in different social psychology settings will help to establish sound decisions and offer many opportunities on possible welfare improvements. The economy in such a setting needs to be able to derive well defined policies that appreciate the law of capacity utilisation than the implications of the increase in supply only. This will be a starting point for inducing behavioural changes relevant to social settings.

4.13	 INSPIRATION INSIGHT AND POSITIVE AFFECTS
We might hear an individual say that ‚ÄúI had an inspiration,‚Äù where ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù refers to the idea itself, not to the motivational response. In the scientific context, the term ‚Äúinsight‚Äù can be used to describe the process by which a problem solver suddenly moves from a state of ‚Äònot knowing how to solve a problem‚Äô, to a state of ‚Äòknowing what is the problem‚Äô and ‚Äòhow to solve the problem‚Äô (Mayer, 1992). Insight has also been conceptualized as the cognitive content that enters consciousness suddenly; the ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment (Csikszentmihalyi & Sawyer, 1995). Regardless of its exact usage, insight can be differentiated from inspiration in terms of its theoretical function. Our search for insight means we are attempting to use cognitive mechanisms, such as ‚Äòrestructuring ideas ‚Äòthat lead to a state of ‚Äòawareness‚Äô (Ohlsson, 1984). Inspiration, on the other hand, is also considered as an attempt, but to use or optimise the ‚Äòmotivational response‚Äô that is followed by a state of ‚Äòrealisation‚Äô (Thrash et. al., 2010). Other researchers believe that inspiration does not always follow insight, however, Thrash, et. al. (2010) consider that a creative ideation process leads to inspiration. Individuals with a strong approach tend to be inspired to create insight, whereas individuals with a weak approach report feeling a lack of inspiration, in spite of their insight. Inspiration thus has important implications for the behavioural transmission of an insight into a competitive product. Sudden changes in insight have been found to inspire an individual with elevated levels of a positive affect and perceived truth regarding his or her solution (Topolinski and Reber, 2010). In cases where there are rare abilities and opportunities for transformation or creation of change, inspiration that follows insight can occur while trying to solve a problem.

A positive affect (PA)¬†is related to insight. With a PA there is a description of how humans experience positive¬†emotions¬†and interact with others and surroundings.¬†Individuals with a high positive affect are typically enthusiastic, energetic,¬†confident, active, and alert. Those having low levels of a positive affect can be characterized by¬†sadness,¬†and un-pleasurable engagement.¬† There are different PA scales that assess different emotions for the measurement of enjoyment and an excitement feeling, or a scale for measurement according thrill-seeking behaviour. The PA influences attention, focus and behavioural repertoire, and this helps to overcome or deal with distressing situations. PA resources are usually physical, such as better health and social support networks. Intellectual and psychological outcomes also come with insights that lead to a PA, especially if it is related to resilience, and optimism. PA‚Äôs are therefore found to provide a psychological break from¬†stress. An activated positive affect (PA) is also considered to correlate strongly with inspiration (Thrash and Elliot, 2003). The term ‚Äúinspired‚Äù appears with the measurement of an activated PA which is present during motivation and resembles one of the inspiration process components (Watson, et. al., 1999). Experiences of inspiration involve greater levels of personal responsibility compared to experiences of an activated PA as per Thrash & Elliot (2004). Inspiration also might not meet PA timings, i.e. while a PA might be at its peak, inspiration might be at its beginning. An example, of this is a Friday when we are excited by the weekend, while our inspiration has not occurred yet (Thrash, 2007). Inspiration and an activated PA is triggered by ‚Äòreward salience‚Äô, while inspiration is triggered proximally by ‚Äòexperiences of insight‚Äô and distally by ‚Äòopenness to experience‚Äô. A PA is often present during states that approach motivation (Watson et. al., 1999). Although insights, inspiration and an activated PA overlap to some degree empirically and conceptually, considerable evidence supports their discriminant validity (Thrash and Elliot, 2003). Experiences of inspiration involve greater levels of transcendence compared to experiences of an activated PA (Thrash and Elliot, 2004). Inspiration and an activated PA have different proximal and distal antecedents. Insights of inspiration are triggered proximally by experiences of insight and distally by openness to experience. Finally, inspiration and an activated PA have different distributions across days of the week; on Fridays, for instance, an activated PA is at its peak while inspiration might be low (Thrash, 2007). A PA manages the fluid transition from insight to inspiration. Consequences of insight, may lead to inspired motivation. However, insight can occur without inspiration. Dispositional factors and situational factors, when opportunities for transmission are not available, can establish inspiration. Inspiration can occur outside the problem-solving context and without a discrete and sudden insight.

Perspiration is considered the highest obstacle to a search for inspiration. Without perspiration we are not able to reach inspiration. Thomas Edison (1903) once remarked that ‚Äúwhat it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration‚Äù. Effort has been, and still is, the most important key to better creativity, however for inspiration, by comparison, effort is unimportant (Martindale, 2001;¬†Sawyer, 2006). Fehrman and Petherick (1980)¬†studied inspiration‚Äôs role in an explanation of creativity. Many of us when exposed to creative work, attribute our creativity to insights or inspiration, instead of attributing this to the efforts undertaken. This confusion has made many people think that creativity comes only to the gifted and not to those who give a lot of perspiration towards their achievements. In three studies of different types of writing related to poetry, science, and fiction, using a self-reported state inspiration test, it was found that the repetition of the writing process helped in the creativity of the final product (Thrash et. al., 2010b). One study confirmed this fact using a CT Scan. In the same study, covariates of inspiration as effort and a PA, failed to mediate transmission, indicating that the transmission function is unique to inspiration only.

5.1	 SOURCES OF INSPIRATION
Today the sources of inspiration have spread from being limited to the scope and capacity of leaders, mentors, role models, and/or national heroes to become an important source for public active participation in many sectors of life (Dess and Picken, 2000; Tjas et. al., 1997). One can find inspiration sources in almost everything from observing best practices, to reflecting on reading and even by practicing drawing or writing, or further by continuing learning about ways to¬†change the world. Any source that is capable of evoking inspiration is considered important. Also, certain phenomena such as media openness, or an increase of higher education graduates are also considered to be indirect sources of inspiration (McCrae and Costa, 1997). Almost in all cultures and types of religions righteous people or humble scholars are seen as a source of divine inspiration. Sometimes being in love with something passionately can create inspiration. For example, being in love with a nation, family, woman or even a hobby can be a source for inspiration for many years of one‚Äôs life dedication (McCutchan, 1999). Haidt (2003) observed that inspiration happens when we experience an elevation of positive emotions supported by a frequency of repetition and self-admiration. Steele (1977) found that even viewing inspirational speeches can be a good source of inspiration that leads first to motivation and then general activation. Social comparison, as per Lockwood and Kunda (1999), is seen to be another important source for community inspiration. Taylor and Lobel (1989), for example, reviewed evidence that cancer patients prefer contact with other patients who are doing better than they are, so that they can gain inspiration and coping information; and this confirms the importance of social comparison (Helgeson & Taylor, 1993). Lockwood and Kunda (1999) supported this study when they found that exposure to high-achieving role models led participants to adopt more positive self-conceptions and inspired them to set higher aspirations. This created a realisation that becoming a role model can be realistically attainable.

You can get inspiration from everything around you. It comes to you from challenges, event, needs, wants, movies, media, books, travel, internet, art, etc. An inspiration source can come from dreams supported during youth by parents, grandparents, teachers or even friends. Hence, we can consider that inspiration sources are evoked by a person or object, in the external environment, where the individual or even the community are moved by what is good or beautiful or missing in that source (McClelland and Kirshnit, 1988). Through focusing on the responsiveness of the inspired, these sources differ in their abilities and intensity to create the necessary inspiration that evokes actions. Inspiration occurs mainly due to practice. Sometimes inspiration occurs due to holding to your belief or being affirmed to what you want, or through having a vision, or being a credible source. Sometimes through realising progress, we can create success stories that can be a source of inspiration. With more sources of inspiration the higher the probability of a sustained impact from this inspiration. Sources of inspiration, such as arts, science and humanities, touch people‚Äôs lives at every level, and this will later contribute to our ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô. Once our basic needs have been satisfied we start to believe that life is ‚Äòworth living‚Äô. And once our contribution to life starts on the basis of give and take, we then witness a raising level of civilisation in our mindset. This leads us to understand our role in the world or our community‚Äôs socio-economic development. Thus, sources of inspiration are important, since they make life more attractive to us, and thus make us more ready to contribute again. Sources of inspiration need interaction. For example, when we attend a concert or a theatre, visit an art exhibition, wander in a museum or heritage site, read a book, or explore best practices of a world-class company, we simply explore more about what it means to be human, but also we are exposing ourselves to different sources of inspiration. Activities, such as these, enrich our thoughts, and develop our understanding of our own lives. The combination of the sources of inspiration, not only explode and excite our imagination‚Äôs abilities, but give us a safe emotional outlet that helps us to be inspired with other human activities and most of all discover our intrinsic powers. Sources of inspiration might even differ in their level of intensity or amount of frequency needed to create inspiration based on the source itself or on the inspiring target. The source of arts and humanities, for example, allows our human experience to grow and make us focus on a variety of inspiration sources without much limitation. Therefore, one could say that sources of inspiration today collectively establish the driving-force of what can be called the cultural ecosystem. Today, more and more you will find a hybrid business and social entrepreneurship programmes that support the establishment, for example, the rich cultural heritage and practices utilising live theatre.

People might be first inspired by their families, upbringing conditions, or even their communities. This type of inspiration is called ‚ÄòUpbringing Driven Inspiration‚Äô. Other people might be inspired by their working conditions, and this type of inspiration is called ‚ÄòOrganisational Driven Inspiration‚Äô. Other people are seen to be inspired by challenges, successes and failures in life and this type of inspiration is called ‚ÄòEnvironmental Driven Inspiration‚Äô. Finally, we also see that much inspiration comes from the inner self that develops the spirit of persistence of being a value added figure in life, and this type of inspiration is called ‚ÄòInnerSelf Driven Inspiration‚Äô. Therefore, the type of source of inspiration will make or create a major differentiation in the final inspiration outcome.

5.2	 INSPIRATION AS A PROCESS
Wallas (1926), one of the earliest to suggest that inspiration is a creative process, noted that it consists of four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Inspiration would be dominated by the conscious during preparation and verification, whereas unconscious, unwilled processes are responsible for incubation and for producing illumination. Later, Kris (1952) explained that creative inspiration enables the individual to be involved in flexible thinking, thus making novel associations more likely. Opportunities once captured, a promising idea emerges. Inspiration then evolves as a process which generates a novel idea (Ward et. al., 1995). Certain researchers found that the process of merging unrelated images may yield pre-inventive forms of inspiration that are extended to a new invention (Finke, 1995). Inspiration as a process tends to be associated with the ability to visualize what is needed to generate ideas. It is noted that inspiration as a process has been accepted in almost all cultures since the beginning of humanity. In ancient Greece Plato suggested that poets may start the inspiration process by influencing their readers through their words (Rothenberg & Hausman, 1976). The process of inspiration can even simply start by integrating two ideas together to create new abilities for people or envision and study the implications (Ward, 2001).

The emergence of creative ideas in consciousness occurs as an inspiration process often during a moment of insight. Under optimal conditions and when it has the capacity for creating change, there will be both a process of ‚Äòbeing inspired by‚Äô, followed by a process of ‚Äòbeing inspired to‚Äô, which provide continuity of action. If the process leads to creative inspiration it is often found that it leads to transmission and actualization too (Thrash, et. al., 2010).

5.3	 BETWEEN EXPERIENCE AND INSPIRATION
Experience for a long time has been both a source of ‚Äòslow inspiration‚Äô and an obstacle for life‚Äôs real ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô. With experience we grow, but we do not actually develop. With total dependence on our experience we keep our abilities contained in the past not in the future. Only when we stop looking backward, we can look forward, or able to give time to absorb the moment, or even able to forecast about what is coming clearly and accurately. The level of human intelligence is found to be related to both experience and inspiration that leads us to levels beyond estimation and forecasting. Intelligence is about the ability to foresee the future, and this is what both experience and inspiration give us. This means that we, as humans, have similar intrinsic intelligence opportunities that depend on our abilities to see something from within or outside our contained boxes. The more we let go of our claimed experience, the more we can overcome our paradigm obstacles, and thus open the blind spots surrounding our visionary insight. Once we overcome the ego and the accumulated attachment to the past, inspiration will occur. When inspiration occurs, we will be eager to go back to experience, or to seek selective solutions, and to look forward for new solutions that we call discovery. Robert Kiyosaki mentioned in his book ‚ÄúRich Dad Poor Dad‚Äù how he and his friend when they were 9 years old were inspired by discovery. Kiyosaki reached this discovery by visualising and comparing their feelings with those superior school colleagues who came from richer families. Kiyosaki mentioned that this hurt was good, because it inspired him and his other poor friend to keep thinking of a way to make money.

High self-esteem and good self-confidence, as essential traits for today and the future economy, depends on experience that comes from trying. Inspiration occurs as we move away from codependence to independence depending on the frequency of experience. This level of confidence will not stay without continuous practice. The history of inspiring leaders, including Gandhi, shows that all of these leaders had in the beginning to fake it, till they made it. ie Through a gradual practice of showing to be confident, it became a reality and truly part of their attitudes and hence confidence became part of who they are. Therefore, if you have a problem with how other people see you, becoming a source of inspiration requires that you first deal with your difficulties by accepting more and more challenges. However, one has to remember that whatever we do; we will not manage to suite all people‚Äôs satisfaction. This is why inspiring people always see the big picture, rather than trying to suite other people‚Äôs wishes or tastes. With time people change, simply because they become more persistent. Inspiration requires building the ability to keep getting up after experience of failures. There will be plenty of failures, as you try to discover what inspires you. Inspired people are unique, because they are more prepared to make decisions that will not always succeed and this is what differentiates their experience, with time, over others. This is because those who are inspired know that if risks are not taken, then the potential for success will not be realized. This is why they are different and why they achieve more.

5.4	 HUMBLENESS WITH OBJECTIVITY AS SECRETS OF INSPIRATION
We become more humble when we are more inspired. This feeling of humbleness makes you feel, in a way, that still your best abilities are hidden within yourself and have not yet been discovered, thus you need to strain your ego. The objectivity that leads to this moment of truth, when we see with our eyes, the heart and the minds of others, or inspiring sources, make us unique in our ability to deal with opportunities. Humbleness, on the other hand, creates time for us to enhance our inquiry and feed our curiosity. Therefore, when both the act of objectivity meets the practice of humbleness one can see the value of self-esteem (Robins et. al., 2001). Exploring operational integrity, with the availability of both humbleness and eagerness of high objectivity, enhances the quality of the products and services we deliver. When we, and then most of our society, are inspired with this style of humbleness and objectivity, we will try as a community to monitor and resent any oppressiveness, and thus try to have social balance in the distribution of power. Great inspiration moments come after structured or unstructured humility that make us face the moment of truth. Life teaches us that, after many years of maturity, we can see the moment of truth easier, however we miss the spirit of youth that helps us to move faster and leaner. Studying the wisdom of humbleness in the holy scripts of the major religions in the world tell us that the moment of truth comes when we realise the essence of humility to failing to see or realise the depth of what we read or believe. Reading and reflecting on the best inspiring leaders and gurus that affect our life also tells us that we need to be prepared to cope with humiliation, to realize our self-potential, as this opens many learning or unlearning opportunities. The more this learning and unlearning happens, as part of a society norm, it differentiates the economy towards being agile and competitive. You will find among the anecdotes that a success story begins after people start to recover from a humiliation and absorb the lessons from it. Consistent practice of humility and/or seeds of humbleness to one‚Äôs self, while taking the pauses of self-evaluation, have been found to help our spirit¬†to be stretched to further higher goals, thus not being discouraged by growing pains. Getting used to humility, by choice, makes us realize how to deal with situations when people stand in our way.¬†Therefore, the exercise of humility helps us to develop what we call a ‚Äúthick skin‚Äù and a ‚Äúheart of great compassion‚Äù towards unleashing the truth that we are searching for. Only when we study the lives of those who have created a major change in our times and how they reached their legacy, will we appreciate the importance of patience on the experience of humility that we need with our brain. This exercise makes us value our next role and assignment, if it proves to be of value to the world as a whole.

Besides the need for creating a humble individual, inspiration requires objectivity. You will rarely see an inspired person, or a society, think just about producing more without a planned effect. Actually, part of the goals of inspiration sees more clearly the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen‚Äù to start a journey that might take most of our life‚Äôs commitments. This is called ‚Äúpull thinking‚Äù and it is a type of dynamic mindset that makes us more selective. Inspiration is about ‚Äúpull thinking‚Äù that is very selective and this differentiates it from ‚Äúpush thinking‚Äù which targets only to fulfil our life with needs based on bulk and quantity. The differentiation in the thinking helps us more towards being ‚Äúinspired‚Äù and not only ‚Äúambitious‚Äù. One cannot realise a strong life legacy based on inspiration, if the search starts with ego or bias. The more we follow an objectively based, or scientifically evidenced, search for truth, the more we achieve a real inspiration milestone and control our ego. However, objectivity cannot be easily achieved, but practicing objectively based methodologies is possible. Keeping the freedom of questioning anything with what, why and how surely enhances our ability to be more objective, in search of what might be an inspiration for us, or our communities. Objectivity therefore can benefit from economic analysis, to make individuals respond systematically to market changes. Currently, the incentives set from outside, motivate people to act in a predictable way. However, in order to make people more humble to discover the unknown within themselves, we need to help them towards the unpredictable, i.e. through understanding their intrinsic capacities, capabilities, competencies and changeability‚Äôs; which we call the 4 C‚Äôs, that openly measure and optimise intrinsic powers. Market outcomes and stability are found to be affected by the level of society‚Äôs openness to self-search and re-orientation with blind spots of current practices. Even though inspiration is sometimes affected by extrinsic motivation, mostly self-initiative creates competitive advantage for most of those making the difference in their life journey. Self-search leads to focused persistent initiatives that overcome all types of obstacles ahead. Self-driven inspiration is a behaviour that influences many areas of socio-economic and political life. The integration of self-driven inspiration with socio-economy produces practices that increase the possibility of transformation towards an inspiration economy. Even the availability of ethics, self-monitoring and transparency, will lead to a higher probability of inspiration. People under intentional focused interventions, are found to be more capable to build a sense of self-determination and objectivity which affects how we perceive our role in life. With focused interventions, feelings of objectivity and the need for humbleness and social harmony might be achieved in our communities (Deci and Ryan, 1985).

One of the benefits of reaching a state of objectivity is having the ability to come up with a different variety of self-initiated inspirations. People have a high interest at this stage in the activity‚Äôs result and try to attain more intrinsic based inspiration (Frey und Osterloh, 2001). Identity and ego can lead to decisions that stand in conflict with rational self-search that this stage of high objectivity requires. A strong identity can also undermine all the economic incentives given with such initiatives (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000).

5.5	 INSPIRATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION
One of the most important organisations we need to focus on as enablers of an inspiration based economy are the departments of Education, Higher Education and Social Development Institutions. For example, Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) have the responsibility to build clusters that fulfil the needs of community education and lifelong learning programmes which therefore ease the enablement of inspiration. A HEI should be structured around meeting market capability by raising the capacity of the source. In order for a HEI to be a source of inspiration, we need to improve the academic and teaching faculty‚Äôs practical teaching, coaching, and counselling experience. A HE needs to have ‚Äòeducation mediators‚Äô, so they can offer further training opportunities that benefit both themselves and older people.

The creation of inspiration in a country can be enhanced and sustained if there are practices of closer co-operation between higher education and other industries. Inspiration facilitates more active dialogue between academics, researchers and practitioners. Inspiration encourages a more active role in developing creative alliances between education organisations and the rest of society. The problem with education today is that it is aiming not at the development of individuals as an end, but more as tools for the economic process. In inspiration driven education the opposite is true. However, the individuals are the focus of any socio-economic process in higher education activity, and thus other things can be used as instruments. This concept can help to develop more space for a society civic role in higher education. Through careful design of higher education processes many multi-cultural issues can be overcome through re-engineering of the assumptions, the loyalties and the differences of past generations. For example, Ireland through its higher education, managed to introduce a collective re-interpretation, analysis and deep understanding to the future direction and sources of unity for the country. Today, higher education arts, humanities and social sciences play a role in shaping the way people live in multiracial communities. Higher education organisations are expected to focus more in the coming years on ‚Äòblended learning‚Äô and integration of humanities with a scientific based curriculum to create more opportunities for inspiration. Students will be able in such a blended environment to practice ‚Äòinnovative thinking‚Äô earlier in their studies, and thus explore more opportunities much earlier. The cognitive processes offered by such students are really amazing compared to their short experience. The process of inspiration in higher education organisations therefore means that they need to interact with similar entities and even outside the scope of such organisations globally. Higher education needs to integrate specifically with the civil and public service, non-government agencies and private sector industries where each one of them can complement the expertise needed to build inspiring lifelong learning realistic academic programmes. This presents opportunities in teaching as well as other countless opportunities for research.

5.6	 EDUCATION IN AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY
In an inspired based economy, education is considered the main enabler that can ensure fair chances and opportunities are given to every member of the community. Ensuring access to education and training with high availability anytime, anywhere and with different styles of teaching can be expected from an inspiring government, organisations and communities.

Models of basic education in an inspiring economy have different providers with broad-based primary, secondary and post-secondary alternatives. The education system optimises different business partnership programmes to create the necessary inspiration that increases educational outcomes. Communities and policy-makers use lifelong learning to enhance inspiration too, by providing flexible and varied educational opportunities that ensure access to the necessary knowledge at any point in an individual‚Äôs lifetime. Inspiration based education will provide child learning by fun as a priority. The ability of students to use their development skills to capture opportunities can be customised to each student‚Äôs needs. Inspiration based education considers access to higher education and the transferability of students, both from country to country and from discipline to discipline, as one of the main criteria for a successful educational system. Another educational performance criterion is level inspirational learning and earning that students experience in school and the educational system. The educational system should create strong accountability and transparency in a way that provides educators with insights on what happens to students after they complete their education. This inspires education planners and teachers to know what type of influence or impact they are creating or can create. It is also helpful to define students‚Äô necessary skills that need to be gained and maintained during the lifetime journey. An inspirational based educational system requires consistency in gathering and analysing data that helps to create knowledge about the type of policies that lead to better desired outcomes and higher availability of job creators not job seekers. Inspiration in the educational process means we have ‚Äúhuman capital‚Äù capable of having a consistent developing effect on the community. Educational institutions need to develop a curriculum that supports essential disciplines like science, technology and engineering while addressing the emerging need for global literacy. The educational system should be based mentoring programmes that motivate more participation for those with experience in business or civil society to become teachers and/or to be flexible enough to allow the necessary changes in discipline or profession during different times of the life journey. An inspirational based economy encourages innovative research and development and allows even the level of elementary schools to license and retain the intellectual property they create or source funding of a commercial venture. Schools should be expected to work on promoting social and global business education partnerships.

Inspirational based education requires collaborative approaches that enhance the use of technology in learning and lifelong learning curricula. This should be supported by school mentor programmes and community-based initiatives. Also, in order for inspiration to be sustained it requires benchmarking and the embracement of best practices from different regions in the world. Schools are supposed to be measured not only about their curriculum and services, but also whether they are managing to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship that rewards risk-taking student initiatives. An inspiration economy therefore needs innovative, self-assessing educational institutions where innovation, inspirational practices and technology enablement infuse in every part of the curriculum, where students and educators are constantly being challenged to strive to solve problems and think ‚Äúoutside the box‚Äù. The creation of new ideas that come from the integration of different industries ultimately increases national competitiveness and leads to realised development outcomes.

Research on leading countries in the PISA report, such as Scandinavian countries, suggests that spending on pre-primary education brings the greatest return on investment, followed closely by spending on primary schools. However, in an inspiration economy our area of focus needs to be on fostering, and growing, both inspired and creative capital. Inspired creative capital is found by those who pioneer change or adopt new technologies early. Education leaders need to think about inspiring programmes that trigger imagination by challenging students in different situations to query whether there are new ways to do things differently, or whether they can make an analogy, or borrow, or adapt a new methodology, or merely need more of the same, or do just less of the same. This type of critical thinking is supposed to create more queries about substitutes or re-engineering of the processes. Teachers should facilitate students‚Äô thinking by adding the ‚Äúwhat if ‚Äôs‚Äù in the assessment scenario with planning and case studies. For example a teacher might ask ‚Äúwhat would happen if we do just the opposite‚Äù or ‚Äúif ideas are combined‚Äù. A teacher‚Äôs role is therefore not about transferring information or knowledge, but rather facilitating knowledge transfer and even challenging students to think what else they can make, or develop, based on community challenges and/ or opportunities.

5.7	 INSPIRATION THROUGH ARTS AND HUMANITIES
It is known that arts and humanities have played and are still playing a major role in our mindset and even ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô. Art and humanities address one of our basic subsistence needs since they are trying to address life issues in an innovative way and thus make us feel that life is worth living. Observations of different civilisation levels have been found to be highly related with arts and humanities literature and practices. Arts and humanities research underpins our experience when we attend a concert or a theatre, visit an art exhibition, a museum or a heritage site, read a book, or simply wonder what it means to be human. Activities, such as these, it is thought, enrich our understanding of our own lives, fire our imaginations, give us a safe emotional outlet, help us to feel that we share fascinations with others and belong to a continuum of human activities, all of which make us happy. Arts and humanities practices and literature allow us to grow our body of knowledge on all aspects of human experience, agency, identity and expression, as constructed through language, literature, artefacts and performance.

5.8	 INSPIRATION THROUGH THE ART OF GIVING
Being inspired by philanthropic deeds of others or through innovation in the way of giving or social entrepreneurship¬†will help us to think in a new way about how to give and contribute to our communities. Such a type of inspiration requires passion.

The more we challenge our commitment to giving or dealing with sensitive global metalevel issues the more there would a potential inspiration. Inspiration based on giving weighs what community needs and how change happens based on the desired¬†outcomes¬†of giving. Inspiration is about the impact that is created based on immediate and lifetime giving. The process of inspiration starts when one decides about what giving he/she wants to direct and to what area of interest and types of strategies they want to fund. There is need to decide how you want to make your giving decisions: alone or with others through a¬†giving circle or creating a community of givers and activists. This is the same as what Bill Gates did for the Wealth Pledge Club. It is a club that focuses on inspiration that leads to unique lifetime contributions and address both values and community needs. Organisations have a major role in creating practices of inspiration economy models. Organisations need to maintain the strive towards an agile and innovative environment. Each stage in the innovation cycle requires a type of leadership movement. Many organisations work on the basis of the ancient Chinese proverb ‚ÄúIt is better to light a candle than complain about the dark‚Äù. Multidisciplinary organisational high performance labs try to generate the highest value in a transparent, iterative and empirical loop. Such teams try to create an emergent innovative inspiring environment.

5.9	 INSPIRATION LABS¬©
Inspiration Labs¬© were developed by Dr Buheji in 2008, based on society‚Äôs needs in relevance to meeting the capacity for creating and maintaining inspiration in different sectors. Inspiration Labs as a concept based on ‚Äòlearning by doing‚Äô has proved to be a source of radical change for inspiration that creates a positive change in Overall Productivity Effectiveness (OPE) performance by creating higher economically value added processes and activities. Organisational inspiration labs target to inspire professionals in being more agile and persistent in what they are supposed to and can deliver. Through these unique inspiration based labs many chronic problems were solved and many people were inspired. Buheji (2014) talked about the developed tools of inspiration labs that lead to success stories. The labs are unique in discovering inspired methodologies for tracking the ‚Äúwhat to change‚Äù and enhancing the source of inspiration. These types of inspiration labs represent a school of thought that focus on creating inspiring institutions that lead to inspiring communities.

One of the early organisations and sectors that benefited from inspiration labs was the Ministry of Education. Also, a specific poor performing airline was assessed based on the capabilities of self-managed change that leads towards better competitiveness based on the lab results. Many inspiration labs were conducted in the area of healthcare relevant to inspiring the physician, family doctors, nurses, health visitors, social workers, and dieticians; on how to capture and help in the reduction of chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD‚Äôs) (which consist of Diabetes, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol and Obesity) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) community. These healthcare inspiration labs focused on discovering intrinsic powers through early detection that improves the quality of life and minimises Cardio-Vascular diseases. Inspiration Labs were also carried out to re-engineer health centre services through a smart classification of practices. Along these labs were small inspiration labs contributed towards the restoration of the Family Medical Practices Programme through effective GP‚Äôs, that is supposed to help in family disease prevention and not only treatment.

As food poisoning is another issue in many hot and humid countries another radical change was undertaken in the public health sector, especially for the tourism driven economy. Inspiration Labs were launched for building an ‚Äòintelligent inspection‚Äô that focuses on potential risk especially with fast food, to protect consumers and enhance the country‚Äôs tourism with the available resources. These efforts helped in the mitigation of food contamination or risk of being poisonous to a low level. The realisation for effective industrial zones was another project that targeted on making the Arabian Gulf Cooperation Councils (GCC) a strong logistic area for many countries around the world. Inspiration Labs focused here on the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) in the free zone areas through focusing on space utilisation vs. inspiration impact. To complement this an Inspiration lab was also carried out towards the enhancement of the role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) towards motivating a knowledge based economy. Inspiration labs also managed to help achieve an optimisation in the practices that Increase the revenue of the annual collection of the ‚Äòzakat‚Äô (Muslims self-driven 2.5% taxation scheme) through an increased image portfolio of the outcome of the projects that they were used for. Inspiration labs were carried out to support national programmes that target to raise the readiness of national human capital and their knowledge assets in the ICT communications technology and hospitality sectors to compete at the level of the Gulf region thus enhancing GDP and reducing the rate of unemployment to a minimum. One of the Inspiration labs main successes was inspiring many of the society decision makers from all the sectors to participate in building a national plan to achieve an impact in the advancement of Bahraini woman‚Äôs society with a focus on legacy based outcomes that lead to stability and competitiveness of the whole society. Another similar programme was carried out for aligning government entities to produce comprehensive Key Performance Indicators and Outcomes in the relevant areas of Quality of Life, Lifelong Learning, Preservation of Resources, Knowledge Economy and National Economy. Another opportunity for inspiration labs was achieved through participation in the enhancement of the social insurance contribution in national economy investments, pension fund stability and in economic sustainability. Inspiration labs also helped in minimising the impact of non-performing schools on graduating students‚Äô competitiveness, regardless of their competency, and thus ensured a levelling of the type of calibre expected to be offered by all the national schools to the labour market.

Other inspiration labs were carried out during the financial crisis to minimise the dependency of enterprises‚Äô success based on government aid funds. In the area of environment, inspiration labs were carried out to improve hygiene operations and recycling of waste from both the consumers‚Äô side and also waste management operating companies. Inspiration labs also participated to enhance the Return on Investment (ROI) in fisheries practices and the marine food industry. Value Stream Mapping was carried out, as part of the Inspiration Labs, to enhance the lead time for the connectivity of electricity and water services, thus inspiring consumers and investors in executing the order for connections. Also, in the same time inspiration labs focused on the utility bills collection management programme to reduce the unpaid government and non-government bills by more than 50% in 3 years only. Other inspiration projects focused on minimising the outages of electricity and also minimising water leakage in the main supply system thus preserving more than 25% of wasted budget due to electricity outages or leaked supplied water. In the area of education, the Inspiration Lab managed to achieve a major paradigm shift in the way public education is managed and looked at. The labs focused on the importance of inspired students compared to competent and gifted students. The labs managed to source and culture the importance of inspired students to the country‚Äôs sustained economy. A major national project had more than 65,000 Bahraini students in high schools participating in evaluations, interviews and focus groups which were supported by more than 700 teachers trained in lab measurement techniques. The purpose of the lab was to create a clear impact and shift in the mindset of the graduates, i.e. to be job creators not job seekers. The Inspiration lab also enhanced the re-designing of curricula that focused on student creativity through sustained traceability and an accumulated affect plan. The size of the gap between national and non-National labour is the concern of every country today. Through the inspiration lab a government plan was set up to minimise the gap by defining areas of competitiveness that the national labour market should secure through the techniques of ‚Äòpull thinking‚Äô. One of the main challenges for many universities is enhancing student‚Äôs fitness or competence to market demands and also ensuring that students finish the requirements of the curriculum as per the planned time, i.e. within four years for bachelor programmes and one and half years for masters programmes. The inspiration labs used the ‚Äòpull thinking‚Äô technique again to improve academic advising services and implementation of smart registration practices.

The other important angle for any university is research and consultancy. The inspiration lab focused on creating Scopas based journals that attract leading authorities to participate in the editorial boards to be managed by multi-national teams thus raising the citations and indexing of the local academic institutions. Also, the open access journal concept was emphasised. This effort was followed by labs that focused on the enhancement of university research plans that address both local and international niches and also on targeting to compete on national projects that are self-funded which lead to better implementation of contractual projects and competitiveness in the fields of scientific research. The labs created a turnover increase of 30% in the area of the research and projects, especially after having the accumulated projects plus current live ones being linked to a knowledge management system that ensured a proper communication framework that enhanced the appreciation of the university‚Äôs internal capabilities and local knowledge asset capital that can be utilised in similar projects. The Inspiration Labs undertook another important project for the university to focus on appropriate student‚Äôs skills, personality, fitness and competitiveness as per the type of specialization or graduation discipline. Skills for engineers were more distinguished than the skills of accountants, to fit the possibilities of what is expected in real life situations.

In order to ensure the concept of the free market does not harm local entrepreneurs and SMEs, an enhancement inspiration lab was held to adjust the size and contribution of tenders that were supposed to be developed from the ‚ÄòNational Tender Board‚Äô towards local small businesses to support entrepreneurship programmes and protect specific sectors to continue their contribution to the national economy. Interesting inspiration labs were carried out to increase entrepreneurs and SME‚Äôs survival rate especially after linking with the national welfare programme that supports family start-ups and productive family programmes. Inspiration labs were carried out towards the reduction of the gap between the requests of housing services and the time of the actual receipt of housing through shifting the focus and giving priority to typical age groups‚Äô expectation of the type of quality of life versus the type of generation perception. If the results of this lab were carried out and sustained, this would solve many national chronic issues relevant to housing. Such labs would enhance the citizens‚Äô acceptance to the quality of life through housing apartments rather than villas. Inspiration labs helped to re-design the attraction of the Bahraini farmers‚Äô products through establishing what was called ‚ÄúNational Farmers‚Äô Day‚Äù to support the distribution chain through attracting consumers to purchase local vegetables and fruits and arranging deals between hospitality suppliers and local formers. The inspiration for the farmers attracted their children to join their parents in the business instead of being dependent on the Ministry of Labour to find them suitable jobs. Another re-engineering project with the inspiration lab was towards investment on raising the competitiveness of human capital in the hospitality business. This was followed by another lab that focused on re-designing the issue of unemployment through the spirit of entrepreneurship. Enhancement of the sewage system was another focus for the inspiration lab that helped to establish preventive measures and create a blockage free system. Another inspiration lab focused on improving traffic flow and safety of vehicles through proper management of accident black spots (i.e. areas where fatal or near fatal accidents are repeated). There are about 100 projects in the inspiration lab of a similar nature that have been experienced, studied, but may have not been formalised to be properly implemented or written as an academic case study. Some of these have achieved awards of success stories during local, regional or even world class competitions.

5.10	 ORGANIZATIONAL AND BUSINESS DESIGN AND THE IE
Inspiration is linked to the type of business or models we use or work in or with. There is a saying that every organization is optimized to achieve the results it currently receives. The implication is that, in order to achieve new and better results, organizations must respond differently by taking on novel means of evaluating problems, spotting opportunities, and working toward future success. Design of organizational transformation is critical for an inspiration based economy‚Äôs consistency and stability. Transformational plans help us to focus on seeing the outcome of the organisations through a human-centred lens for how they change and evolve, using inspirational techniques. By examining how an organization is set-up to deliver its offerings, we can help it overcome a myriad challenges. Development of spaces, tools, processes, strategies and programmes has been found to create both behavioural and cultural changes. Whenever a company designs a new product, service, or experience, it is essentially designing its ‚Äúinspiration business‚Äù. If the business is well designed it creates offerings that inspire organizations and excite customers. A combination of design thinking and traditional corporate strategies that focus on inspiration help to create an inspiration capacity for both staff and clients that shift towards and impact outcomes not results. By shifting the focus from growth based to development based design processes, we can shed light on new options and explore various alternatives that enhance people and organisations‚Äô ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô and their ability to create a legacy.

5.11	 INSPIRATIONAL LEADERSHIP
One can already see that in our time we are having more and more inspirational leaders, not necessarily with political or economic power; affecting the current time and our societies in a variety of ways. Some of these inspirational leaders are even below 20 years of age. Having more young inspirational leaders moves society towards dynamics and ignites its passion to deliver the best. Inspirational leadership therefore is considered a verb not a noun. Inspiration does not always need a position, since it is based on influence regardless of power. Leadership here means more effective focused competition of renewed powerful ideas. Empathetic thinking is common practice among those using inspirational leadership since their ability to create, invent, compose, construct and design new pathways will be more selective and rapid. Inspirational leadership means you have the capability to influence after you realise, forecast and observe, how to get people to create a means for their life and shape the future with minimal resources compared to others.

Therefore, for an inspirational economy to spread and stabilise this means we need to manage, influence and impact a large number of the world community. Those leaders besides having the above characteristics of unique abilities to create and establish deep understanding; they also need to focus on classifying, examining and illustrating the use of certain inspirational concepts to ensure continuity and high utilization. In an inspirational economy, leadership means the ability to lead or represent a set of functional or professional groups most of the time or a multi-functional group. Inspirational leadership of specialists, researchers and practitioners means those types of people would be eager to inspire us through categorizing, explaining, comparing, contrasting, examining, identifying and investigating sources of inspiration. Once we embrace the practices of inspirational leadership we can inspire our targeted community in a way to reach the sort of influence that Martin Luther King, Jr., Mahatma Ghandi, Winston Churchill, Mohamed Ali Clay, Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are still doing even though most of them have left this world. They are just a few examples of normal people who became a source of inspiration that influenced modern times.

Inspirational leadership has many different achievements that has led to inspirational stories today with a variety of techniques that are managing to sustain a positive change in the world. These types of inspirational leaders act from the inside out, i.e. they do not try to ‚Äòsell their products‚Äô, but are highly committed to ‚Äòsell their beliefs‚Äô. Thus they repeat the¬†same concept time after time in different ways to convince people about what they believe in. The inspiration created by these leaders‚Äô beliefs goes beyond their inner qualities. They are different than any other leaders in history since they are not only self-directed and have a unique resilience capability, but also listen to their intuition very carefully. They clearly have the capability to proactively answer the call of world needs around them. They are committed and dedicated people who see their achievements as important milestones in their life‚Äôs purpose. They are a type of leader who will not be deterred by others‚Äô opinions, even though they might respect them. Inspirational leadership is about daring to attempt ‚Äúthe impossible‚Äù by utilising the unique capabilities of the others while guiding them to the reality of their dreams. When leadership creates inspirations based on values they demonstrate that beautiful society dreams can be easily realised. Once people can see that they can achieve the impossible then they undoubtedly can see their blind spots more clearly and open up to discover new things that unleash their intrinsic capabilities. The main sources of inspiration come from those who carry leadership and create a legacy in history through utilising clear vision, knowledge, faith, commitment and courage. They are a type of people who have managed to extend their great inspiration to create more flexible and adaptable approaches that overcome challenges. Today inspirational leadership stories are increasing due to the availability of social media and ease of communication. Many people are being inspired even from young leaders due to knowing how they became inventive, energetic and with persistence characteristics.

5.12	 IDEATION IMPORTANCE TO THE ECONOMY
When individuals observe extraordinary skill and performance and try to imitate it, they often experience inspiration (e.g., Thrash & Elliot, 2004). Thrash et. al. (2010) showed that genuine creative ideas create a sense of inspiration once linked to life needs and application. Therefore, ideation is very important for a life contribution, once it is approached as part of a creative solution to problems. Thus the frequency and intensity of ideation and its relevant implementation is very important to our contribution to the socio-economy.

The studies of Thrash et. al. (2010) showed that creative ideation tended to proceed inspiration; that is, creative ideation one week tended to predict inspiration the next, rather than vice versa. Thrash et. al. (2010) evaluated how people felt about seminal ideas or when ideas were original, unique, and creative and/or when they were written as poetry. Inspiration does entail transcendence and awareness of unrecognized possibilities. Thus, inspiration is found to be more pronounced in individuals who can surpass habitual patterns of thought and embrace novel perspectives as per the study of Thrash and Elliot (2004). According to these two scientists our ‚Äòreceptive engagement‚Äô (thoughts and perspectives) are epitomized by practices like openness of the mindset and a high absorption from inspirational sources. Thrash and Elliot (2003) have set measures for the frequency and intensity of inspiration to assess the relation of specific tasks, such as writing, drawing and innovating, and evoke inspiration once practiced. The measures had four levels: Level One ‚Äì to measure experiencing inspiration, Level Two ‚Äì to measure what to encounter or how to create an experience for inspiration, Level Three ‚Äì to measure how people are inspired to do something, Level Four ‚Äì to measure the feeling of being inspired, For each level the measure focuses on ‚ÄúHow often does this happen‚Äù to represent frequency and ‚ÄúHow deeply or strongly‚Äù to represent intensity. Thrash and Elliot (2003) also managed to examine factors that are positively associated with behavioural activation such as work mastery, perceived competence, self-esteem, optimism, self-determination and positive emotions. In this study inspiration was not significantly related to social desirability biases. While the authors saw that the confidence and willingness to engage in experiences and entertain many thoughts seemed to be related to inspiration. In describing his creative process and ideation, Mozart observed, that the ideas that pleased him were retained in his memory, and once they occurred to him he turned them to assets that later made ‚Äúa good dish that fires the soul‚Äù (Harding, 1948). Mozart‚Äôs depiction of inspiration shows the amount of realisation of the process of ideation that this exciting and legacy musician had during his life.

The core elements of modern scientific inspiration constructs are therefore based on appreciation of new or better possibilities of ideas that lead to evocation and motivation that bring in new discoveries to life. Like Mozart; many writers, artists, scientists and other game changers have commonly emphasized the importance of inspiration in the creation of ideation (Harding, 1948). Thrash et. al. (2010) distinguished that ideation might go through transcendence, evocation, and approach motivation where ideation seemed to originate from either intentional deliberation or as an unconscious outcome.

5.13	 EVOLUTION OF¬†INSPIRATION ECONOMY
The path to an Inspiration Economy begins with an inspiring vision, a sound strategy that will manifest the vision, and demonstrate a model that will be a source for passion, while travelling the path. For societies to travel along the path of inspiration they need the proper environment to innovate with results in order to grow in today‚Äôs world and stay competitive with high-quality products and services, and they need to commit totally to innovation.

Inspiration generators demolish our fears of failure and create a new source of learning. When we cannot sleep, and are trying to find the Aha moment we are enhancing our inspiration generators. Thus the sleepless nights are actually creating for us chances for a better possibility for creative thinking. Inspiration can evolve faster once there is an innovation-driven economy, the blend of innovative ideas and the spirit of inspiration become the most important raw materials for a new inspiration economy driven business. Evolving towards an inspiration economy means evolution towards a stronger ability to generate ideas. Through such inspiration practices our lives hopefully will become a memory that will stay for a long time. Today there are many sources to enhance inspiration evolution. For example, through social media and the web, crowd funding is just one example that is becoming an effective e-source of inspiration evolution. Crowd funding is about the practice of funding an inspiring project by raising financial contributions from a large number of people, typically via the internet. The crowd funding model is a source of inspiration since it is based on influencing the action of three parties that is the idea project owner, the sponsors who support the idea, and the hosting site management team. Crowd funding built its inspiration on stories that involve people to complete it. Even though these people will never meet they will establish a type of connection and passion with the story.¬†Once a crowd funding structured pledge is completed, the process does not stop here, actually a series of follow-up activities start through the stories achieved with the project.

5.14	 STYLE OF LEARNING AND INSPIRATION
Learning has both a direct and indirect influence in creating the cycle of inspiration. The main learning techniques that are directly related to inspiration are going to be characterized as active, collaborative, and cooperative and problem based learning. Active learning is perceived as a radical change. Compared to ‚Äòtraditional instructed learning‚Äô, ‚Äòactive learning‚Äô engages people in the learning process through doing meaningful learning activities and thinking about what they are doing. The core elements of inspiration happen when people activate ‚Äòreflection‚Äô on the information and knowledge targeted. For inspiration ‚Äòcollaborative learning‚Äô is considered one of the sources for long lasting learning. Collaborative learning refers to learning in which students work together in small groups toward a common goal.

Collaborative and cooperative learning have both different distinct historical developments and philosophical roots. In collaborative learning the emphasis is on student interaction rather than on learning as a solitary activity. Cooperative learning however is structured group work learning that pursues common goals while being assessed individually. Cooperative learning depends more on inspirational economy skills where the individual‚Äôs accountability, mutual interdependence, face-to-face interaction, and the sustained self-assessment creates another form of learning. In order for learning to be consistently inspirational; learning should be always brought to the learners, using a range of imaginative methods. An attempt to provide equivalency of accreditation with formal learning, using non-formal approaches, helps to bridge the gender divide. Sustained inspirational learning as shown in Figure (5-2) is a process of learning engagement that occurs based on the inspiration learning style as ‚ÄòLearning by Doing‚Äô or ‚ÄòFlipped Class‚Äô, for example, that creates a collaboration based platform that carries the inspirational spirit and is incubated through taking pauses and undertaking more reflection.

Another learning style is learning through people empowerment such as the utilization of ‚Äúflipped classroom‚Äù models. It is a style of learning that depends on creating direct support to make people more aware of their internal power in relevance to relationships and systems. Once people are aware about their internal power they start to be focused in discovering their role towards society. Flipped classrooms, therefore, create a feeling for future students that they can control and inspire their ‚Äúmates‚Äù and peers. Empowerment here is the source of inspiration where the student is better equipped to take control of their life, including their education path. It can be concluded that all the inspirational based learning styles mentioned show that people‚Äôs inspirational cycle starts or completes when they start to reflect depending on the methodology or style of delivery used. One of the reflections on innovative adult learning is that it fuses the theories of participatory rural appraisal in styles as the Daily Toolbox Talk. The participants are encouraged to show their concerns and views and then an action plan is created to tackle a particular problem. It is similar to Japanese Kaizen techniques. Through such discussion the participants learn how community organisations work and develop leadership skills.

5.15	 INSPIRATION AND THE ABILITY TO FOCUS
Even though it starts with feeling of fuzziness; inspiration in reality highly depends on a focus which leads later to less fuzziness. An inspirational spirit can be achieved, only when it combines with a focused mindset. Many inspiring individuals lose their focus after a few years due to losing their passion. Since inspiration is about values, truly inspiring people will try to stay with the truth even if it makes them look bad, in the short run, as they have a target of being focused all the time. Truly inspiring people have the habit and the ability to forgive their enemies as part of their journey of rehabilitating themselves towards being humble or as a way of trying to be focused. Inspiring people are found to spend most of their time talking about the ‚Äúwhat and how‚Äù to overcome troubles, mistakes, and achieve dreams with those they trust. In order to stay as a passionate¬† creative individual you need to talk and discuss what you dream about or your passion. Never hesitate to ask for help. Always also Identify what is really important through making a conscious decision to realign your life goals based on what brings you value, not what society decides is a mark of success. Bill Gates, is a good example of inspirational focus. Gates wrote his first book to focus on the potential coming technology and it was titled ‚ÄúBusiness as the speed of thought‚Äù. He conveyed how his computer programs are becoming big and slow therefore they would not compete in the coming technology era and he was right. After many years, what continues to inspire Gates and keep him focused is his ability to change the game. Gates attributes his achievements in doing that, time after time, to his ability to zoom in the projects of his life and utilise his accumulated experience to deliver a change in how it is delivered. Inspiration of this unique ability is what differentiates the power of Bill Gates compared with many billionaires in this era. Due to this unique focused ability he manages to bring in the richest people of the world to experience the art of giving. Gates is a model of a moving inspiration that shifts from one stage to another, in different arenas and times through the ability of focus. To stay focused, one needs to remove negativity from life. Being negative makes us unfocused on reality. Happiness and satisfaction are found to reduce the times of struggle and loneliness. A balanced way of life leads us to easily accept new excitements and thus create an easier focus again.

5.16	 BALANCED LIFE AS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION
A balanced life means living in a stable and democratic society that provides material resources to meet essential needs. However, a balanced life might mean having a supportive family and friends or even rewarding and engaging work and an adequate income that leads to a consistent source of inspiration. A balanced life means that one must be healthy and profitable and thus addressing important goals related to one‚Äôs values that lead to inspiration. Having a philosophy or religion that provides guidance, purpose and meaning to one‚Äôs life also helps in creating a new wave of inspiration (Diener and Seligman, 2004). Thus a balance of a pleasant, engaged, meaningful life means survival and growth of the needs that leads to sustainable inspiration (Seligman, 2002). A balanced life requires a dedicated life. A life will be worth living if we have all our minds, soles and hearts dedicated to discovering the truth in our relations and contribution.

5.17	 INSPIRATION THROUGH EMPOWERMENT
Empowerment is the slogan of the 21st century. However with inspiration empowerment means that we are going to shift the level of empowerment from sharing knowledge to the level of involvement and engagement in knowledge creation. People in inspiration based practices means they go through the process of supporting the making of a happening. It is a type of empowerment that makes people become aware of their potential and to realize their contribution within society. Inspirational empowerment makes people better equipped to take control of their life through establishing what we call the 4D‚Äôs (Dream- Desire, Determination and Dedication). This can happen through learning by doing or simply education and by many other means. Education is one form of functional inspiration that leads to sustainable empowerment. Moreover, education is an instrument that facilitates developing freedom to critically and creatively deal with reality. Through education we are inspired to discover how to participate in the transformation of the world (Freire, 1985). Education may lead to different levels of inspirational empowerment depending on the situation, context, country, culture and customs. Inspiration increases when a person exercises knowledge and understands the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of what is learned.

An interesting project that focused on inspiration through empowerment was the Life skills project in Indonesia. In an Indonesian national survey conducted in 2010, the Indonesian government revealed that a large majority of Indonesians from rural areas might not attend school. Access to continuing education in urban areas meant long travel times. The Ministry of National Education in Indonesia led an initiative to establish non-formal educational equivalency programmes relating to primary, lower secondary and upper secondary levels. It aimed to teach functional skills, including literacy and vocational skills, incorporating life skills education. The inspirational empowerment technique used in these programmes is that they were offered at flexible times, to enable children and youths to fulfil domestic and family responsibilities while receiving education. The tutoring was sometimes offered ‚Äòdoor to door‚Äô via motorbike, caravan, boat or bus, with each mobile service equipped with learning materials, including multi-media equipment. The empowerment part of education is only one inspirational part of the total picture. Learning, questioning, understanding and challenging are the early measures of empowerment. These measures support what is learned in reality or would be challenging reality to establish profound inspirational levels that are hard to compete with.

5.18	 POSITIVE INSPIRATIONAL POLICIES
Policy has many implications on the level of inspiration. Policies can enhance inspiration through encouraging autonomous, self-sustained practices. In today‚Äôs competitive economy we need a wide range of sources of inspiration measures. Today the EU model is considered to be a model for positive inspiration policy making. Inspirational based policies are needed more and more as we move towards an inspirational economy. These policies‚Äô uniqueness comes from being based on promoting cooperation between regions and countries and enhancing the inspirational outcomes based on real society needs. This requires that such policies understand people‚Äôs needs at various stages of development and at the same time build knowledge of human behaviour as part of a policy implementation plan. There are endless sources of inspirational polices. However, since we are talking about the Inspiration Economy we will focus on sources of inspiration policies that either create a Value Added or would be a source for reducing waste in relevance to all the socio-economic holistic process. Inspiration might happen when you try to discover or even avoid new or mysterious policies or even write a commitment plan that helps to develop society. The sources of inspirational policies as shown in figure (5-3) are triggered by higher level practices that we usually find in the scientist or academic such as sources of knowledge assets, knowledge transfer, knowledge capture, or building up one‚Äôs own perspective, of learning through doing, or due to logical reasoning. Then inspirational policies are supposed to ensure the availability of sources that are triggered by lower level practices, such as sources of inspiration coming from data analysis, or evidence based fact coming from field observations. These policies should be dynamic, i.e. depending on the nature of the process or activity and also on sources coming from absorption, or reflection as a final source of inspiration. When both high and low level sources are integrated, they produce broader realisation and forms that make the final sources of inspirational policies become distinguished as a top priority in being achievement targets.

At the same time as thinking that one must be perfect and/or that people are either good or evil and/or believing that you cannot live without someone or something, all are sources of blockage for inspiration. Failing to equip people with different processes of thinking, writing and problem solving is one of the main blockages of inspiration. Inspiration is relevant to reflections that arise from lifelong learning. Society that is poor in valuing and nurturing its citizen‚Äôs intellectual curiosity will suffer from lack of inspiration generation abilities. Inspiration blockage can be overcome by positive thinking. Just because things do not go the way it is planned does not necessarily mean they have gone wrong. We also overcome blockages if we believe that everyone is born into the world to do something that is unique, value added and distinctive. Benjamin Disraeli, the popular British Writer, said that ‚Äúwe are not creatures of circumstance; we are creators of circumstance‚Äù. This means we sometimes persist to open blockages and sometimes we create blockages ourselves. Blockages bring us to reality and take us from the top of the mountain of our dreams down to earth again. Occasional inspiration alone cannot provide us with new perspectives without being challenged by obstacles.

Arthur Rubinstein, the most popular pianist in the last century, asked us to accept blockages in our life as part of the journey, emphasising that there are no formulas that exist for success, except for living an unconditional acceptance of life and what it brings. While most people ask for happiness on condition; Rubinstein explained that happiness can only be felt if you do not set any conditions. This is why inspiration is meant to be. It is meant to be around those fire candles where you have to touch them to see the way forward. Inspiration that arises as a result of blockages in life is about simplifying what is complicated. Inspiration occurs as a result of discovering our inner strength and thus understanding. Bernie Siegel, the holistic medicine expert, emphasised that we should live inspiration every day; and we should deal with blockages as we are not going to have such moments in life again. Blockages therefore may be meant to make us dare to be ourselves. With blockages we can emerge and unfold the capacities within our possibilities.

5.20	 INSPIRATION AND LIFELONG LEARNING
One cannot easily separate the process of optimising lifelong learning (LLL) and inspiration. Both inspiration and LLL are dependent on the attitude of persistence. Inspired individuals are differentiated from the rest of people in their ability to learn, unlearn and keep learning. This is also a requirement for LLL. Both inspiration and LLL need practices of observing or listening and then realising or recognizing what is happening around us. Inspired individuals are more committed to change wherever and whenever needed. Lifelong learners are more like opportunity seekers who know how to identify the best people and get the most out of them. We can say that inspiration integrates with LLL, since they both focus on ‚Äúlearning through doing‚Äù and even sometimes ‚Äúlearning through playing‚Äù. Both inspiration and LLL have economic impacts, besides helping us live with excitement during life‚Äôs journey.

5.21	 INSPIRATION OF WOMEN AND THE ECONOMY
Differentiation in inspiration history, based on gender, occurred due to different conditions each gender is exposed to. Suppression based on gender is one of the degrading experiences in the history of humanity. One cannot imagine how many great socio-economic opportunities have been lost for people in this world, because they could not be a source of great contribution due to gender inequality. There would have been countless opportunities for many families, communities and nations if they had been able to access equal opportunity policies, practices, paths, programmes and initiatives. No one could have imagined that as we are entering near to the completion of a fifth of the 21st century that we see and talk about issues of women‚Äôs basic empowerment, with still more than one third of the world unable realise their potential.

Inspiration of the economy cannot be complete if we have one half of society, actually the beautiful, smart, hardworking half not effectively utilised, optimised and allowed to contribute with its huge potential. We all share the responsibility for creating or destroying women‚Äôs inspiration, be it as a father, brother, husband or colleague. If woman are inspired the world will witness great harmony, equality, peace and a re-design of many obsolete systems. Even in many places in the world where women are more educated this does not relate to a fair chance in relation to inspiration. In some African, Asian and Arab countries, women‚Äôs education has moved forward rapidly over the past decade, however, this has not always translated into greater representation and equality in the work-place or even opportunity to represent higher level of inspiration (Vishwanath, 2012). The issue of indirect discrimination, or what we call ‚Äúa show woman‚Äôs equality‚Äù, is causing an obstacle towards the contribution of woman in many programmes. In many societies today, women are given positions without empowerment, or even employed as employees with no clear future or career path. As per UNESCO (2012) women‚Äôs statistics are progressing very slowly in literacy, empowerment and equality in rural areas, where opportunities and mobility are limited, and traditional customs and attitudes have persisted longer than many urban areas. Women can play a greater role in an inspiration economy, if they gain access to the same challenges, opportunities of work as their gender counterparts. Today, through statistics women are proven to be a strong competing gender, better selfemployed, self-independent and are even focused social or business entrepreneurs, if they are given similar opportunities to men. Hence, if there are dedicated programmes for inspiring women, these enhance their knowledge and skills towards socio-economy contribution. If women are enabled to be inspired, societies will see many positive outcomes. Women, throughout history, have proved that they are more equipped to manage money and make better decisions about spending and saving. Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel and Andera Gandhi, are just a few examples of women who have changed the fate and history of their countries by inspiring conservative programmes. While we still see many shared experiences of men, through biography, until today we have seen few for women. This is due to many women being denied the opportunity to explore their inspiration achieved in the world. One of the projects that has alerted people to the importance of women‚Äôs inspiration role in the economy is Oxfam (2012) in Nepal called the ‚ÄúRaising Voices‚Äù project. Woman in Nepal are usually invisible because they cannot speak out about what is in their minds. They are rarely encouraged to speak even in their own family.

The Nepal ‚ÄúRaising her Voice Programme‚Äù set out not only to raise women‚Äôs voices, but also to build their confidence, skills and knowledge that lead to an inspiration that will change their lives in their communities (Oxfam, 2012). The programmes focused not only on women‚Äôs literacy, empowerment and equality, but even on speaking and listening. As part of the ‚ÄúRaising her Voice‚Äù programme women in the Baraha Village were invited to enter the village development committee and address issues. This project helped practically to broaden the representation and participation of women. Based on this model and in partnership with local NGOs, the programme was implemented in three other districts in Nepal where women were particularly marginalised. Today Nepal is considered a world class reference for women‚Äôs realised inspirational empowerment and it is a case used in many community discussion classes.

5.22	 CAN RELIGIONS BE A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION?
Unfortunately, we are living in a negative era for what religions do to societies. Today, we see the negative side of religions, as they are becoming, as in medieval centuries, a source of domination, hatred, segregation, etc. In reality did religions, in the best times, inspire people or communities or segregate them? Many sculptures standing today have influenced mankind to understand the external world and even explore it, or with the development of understanding our inner selves, in a way linked with contributing religions. Whether the religion was Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, or any other religion that shaped the life of millions and billions of followers before us, there are many references that they were a source of inspiration for countless stories, art, coexistence movements, human rights movements, etc. Even though religions have had their part to play with aid and wars, it is also believed that religions can be a source of inspiration rather than a source of destruction. If we understand a religion, in its holistic theme and when it is appreciated for such a theme and uniqueness to humanity and not as a source of differentiating oneself from others, then such a religion is a source of inspiration.

5.23	 SOURCES OF INSPIRATION
Sources of inspiration are endless in variety and intensity of types. They might come from playing, experimenting, reflecting, suffering, or¬† enjoying. In fact any source that is like ‚Äúmusic¬†to the¬†soul‚Äù and makes you passionate about something you need to contribute to in life can be a source of inspiration. It is a type of source that makes you take time to¬†think or feel the¬†powers within the inner self. It is the source that brings wisdom along with the spirit of youth. A source of inspiration, in order to stay around us and not disappear, requires that we take time to¬†care about it. The more we deal with these sources as ‚Äúthe¬†fountain¬†of¬†wisdom‚Äù, the more we feel we have discovered the greatest power on earth. Usually, it takes time to build¬†a strong relation with sources of inspiration, but once you have what is required to having this relation well established, no power in the world can stop you, except your intrinsic powers. In order to continuously have renewable power to capture different sources of inspiration, it requires us to believe that this is not a God-given¬†privilege, but that we have worked for it by the Will of God. This is a major difference in the mindset approach and thinking. In an inspiration based economy, sources of inspiration will be the¬†road¬†to¬†happiness and wellbeing. In such an economy, the reserve of knowledge and experience is linked to the extent of the utilisation of inspirational sources.

5.24	 BEST INSPIRATION TIME ‚Äì YOUTH
Time of youth is the time of prosperity. During youth, we can build the real quality of a human being and the more challenges that are managed during this time of life the more wise and giving we become. Youth is the best time to be with your enablers for creating a legacy in this world. Youth will be a main contributor for any socio-economy, if we consider it as a time for opportunity and strength. During the age of 9 to 25 years we can experience a revelation in light of the challenges we face. Mignon McLaughlin said that ‚Äúthere are always some specific moments when we become aware that our youth is gone; but, years after, we know it was much later. Youth is unique as they mostly won‚Äôt look for excuses not acts‚Äù. To find joy in our life journey, it is said that we need to discover our fountain of youth. Inspired youth will not see life as long, actually they will see both days and years as being very short. Albert Einstein used to say that ‚ÄúI live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity‚Äù. In order to see inspiration as the main motivator of any economy, countries and societies need to invest in having youth discovering their own intrinsic powers. The more we manage to do this the more we will have a dynamically transformed economy. The human miracle Helen Keller believed is that ‚Äúit is not possible for civilization to flow backwards while there is youth in the world. Youth may be headstrong, but it will advance its allotted length‚Äù. The more we indulge ourselves during youth in things we might not be able to do when we are old, the more we can sustain our lifelong inspiration. With youth we are free to try many sources of inspiration that we might not be able to do at a later age. Will Durant said ‚ÄúIn my youth I stressed freedom, and in my old age I stress order‚Äù. In youth we can build our learning abilities that can help us to have collective reflection and realisation later. The great Aristotle was surely wise when he said that ‚Äúgood habits formed at youth make all the difference‚Äù. Therefore we believe that competition between countries in the future will not only be on the utilisation of natural resources and human capital, but the amount of success in inspiring the youth.

5.25	 APPRECIATIVE ENQUIRY AS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION
Many developed countries have started to use a concept called ‚ÄòAppreciative Enquiry‚Äô as a source for inspiring the economy. Appreciative enquiry is a technique that focuses on good practices within the society and/or the organisation. In New Zealand, for example, appreciative enquiry is used to generate new ideas in government organisations, as part of a government performance improvement programme. While enquiring about appreciated deeds, each of us can complement the others unique and excellent behaviours, as none of us have all the perfect behaviours. Finding and exploring the best of us, shaping it and sharing it, through appreciative enquiry is a good source for an inspiration based economy. We have been trained unfortunately to see only ‚Äúsuccessful models‚Äù, thinking of a perfect idealistic model. However, this method has proven to be a source of inspiration to a limited number of people. Human science is telling us today that the more we find the good in the other, however bad we see them in the beginning, the more we are going to inspire them for the better sustainability of deeds, or to explore and capitalize on the powers they carry within to improve their and our socio-economy.

It is believed that inspiration through ‚ÄúAppreciative Enquiry‚Äù can be a source for socioeconomic revival for many non-productive and non-contributing societies? We live in an era where focused intelligent productivity is supposed to be much higher than before, due to the availability of technology, ease of transportation, better educational opportunities, etc. However, reports of certain developing countries‚Äô performance, especially in the last decade, indicate that they still have very low productivity per individual. So, we are reverting to ‚Äòappreciative enquiry‚Äô as a possible technique that might enhance the individual and society contribution by making them focused on achievements and outcomes, not just weaknesses and results.

5.26	 ANALOGICAL THINKING ROLE IN AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY
The demand to empower an economy leads us to encourage using creativity in different products, production, and marketing activities. To do so, we need first to make the creative process visible in order to examine it and then generate new ideas from it that will meet our potentials needs. Our understanding of a problem, the way opportunities are made, and how to use creative talent all help in paving the way for us to use analogical thinking to the benefit of creating a competitive inspiring economy. Creativity is a combination of developing alternatives, giving possibilities, enhancing imagination and creating opportunities. For Paul Torrance creative behaviour occurs in the process of becoming aware of problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies; bringing together in new relationships available information; identifying the missing elements; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses. Both creative and inspiration are types of discovery derived from analogical thinking where unlike subjects and situations they are integrated. Therefore, we believe it wise for countries to work on allowing their community members to be inspired by the power of analogical thinking. Human beings in general are programmed to solve problems and thus their learning happens and life experience grows. Being a creative problem solver requires us not only to be alert, but also to use the required technique to generate creative solutions. Inspiration depends upon analogical thinking to address two basic and interrelated approaches in solving problems: first, procedures leading to imaginative speculation; second, disciplined ways of behaving so that speculation is not cut down, but valued and encouraged. To enhance imagination, which is the key to creativity, we have to concentrate on the mechanism needed to identify the problem to search for the solution and picture the product. It is found that a responsive atmosphere is critical to creative productivity. Therefore, listening to another person‚Äôs point of view and ideas is perhaps the single most important aspect of Synectics training and also one of the main keys to create an inspiration wave. To practice being an effective listener, we need to stop giving quick judgment and stimulate the imagination in order to generate original ideas.

Synectics, is a Greek word which means ‚Äúto join two different and apparently irrelevant elements‚Äù. Using Synectic mechanisms is very important for an inspiration based economy, since it increases the possibility of successful problem-solving in groups and individually. With Synectics we increase our probability to create an inspiration using our intrinsic powers. Since the 1960‚Äôs, American industry has started to have benefit from problem solving groups that solve the different US socio-economy problems by suggesting novel ideas. This was approached by building models, conducting experiments, and investigating market potential which paved the way for these industries to reach better production and income than other economies. One of the tools that can be used in problem-solving that enhances our ability to create inspiration is playing with metaphors. Here, we use metaphors as a figure of speech, in which we use a word or phrase that is used to describe something else, in order the show an analogy between two things. For example; ‚Äúwhen you say that this person is the light of my life ‚Äì the person described by this metaphor is not really providing physical light. However, he or she is just someone who brings happiness or joy‚Äù, In such a way, analogical thinking is undertaken by encouraging community members to make analogies between their problem and another object or idea; this will help them to generate new products that have never been created before. This means people‚Äôs capacity will be enhanced to achieve more and this will be another source of inspiration. Certain World class companies and industries have created what is called ‚ÄòThe Company Synectics Group‚Äô. The group job is to solve any problem the company faces, to increase their income and reach customers‚Äô demands. Kimberly-Clark, is a company that makes Kleenex, and since the 1970s it created its synectics group to further improve the production of facial tissue and to re-invent ways to reduce the cost of Kleenex distribution. After several meetings, the Kimberly-Clark team conceived the idea of pressing much of the air out of the tissues, and most tissues could then be packed in the same size box, or the same number in a smaller box. This saved paper board, shipping costs, and warehouse space. Nearly all Kleenex is now packed using the space-saving method. This example shows that when we understand a problem, we easily relate it to things or experiences we know, and we then can use imagination to create an inspiring economical solution.

To reach better levels of inspiring creative problem solving; one must have a certain level of self-motivation, in a way to see problems and challenges as valuable opportunities that empower our thinking, and even inspire us to develop further. Limitation of recourses, culture or community pressure, should not stop the inspired person from producing new valuable ideas. In each case, you first collect data related to the problem, and this should include facts, observation, opinions, feelings, and even any irrelevant materials that might be partly related. Then you use analogical thinking tools to create new and unexpected connections, which will lead to unique solutions or products. The good thing about using synectics and analogical thinking is that it keeps the problem and the creative solution flexible and original. We do not have to choose between ideas or alternatives, instead we can combine a number of ideas and modify them to create the solution for a better alternative. Gordon (1961) mentioned in his book (Synectics the Development of Creative Capacity): that in the creative process, the emotional component is more important than the intellectual and the irrational more important that the rational. With these emotional, irrational elements we can be inspired and thus increase the probability of success with problem-solving. Gordon suggested three types of mechanisms that might help create inspiration during problem-salving sessions: (1) play with words, meanings, and definitions; (2) play in pushing a fundamental law or a basic scientific concept; (3) play with a metaphor.

The synectic process is really one of the future sources of inspiration, since it involves making the strange familiar; and making the familiar strange. With these processes we can use several mechanisms for making the strange familiar and the familiar strange such as having a personal analogy, direct analogy, symbolic analogy and last but not least fantasy analogy. Without the presence of these analogy mechanisms, no problem-stating or problem-solving attempt will have a high probability for success. Each of these analogical mechanisms will provide a spark of inspiration in a unique way. For example, in the personal analogy, the person places himself/herself at the centre of the problem, or sometimes identifies someone with the same feeling and makes him/her the function of an object. Based on this we are then able to gain a new perspective and look for novel insights. A famous example of this way of analogical thinking was Albert Einstein who, as a teenager, asked himself ‚Äúhow would the world appear if I were to travel on a beam of light?‚Äù Then, Einstein asked himself ‚Äúwould it be possible to travel faster than light?‚Äù This analogy helped him to visualise and realise his special theory of relativity. Another type of analogy mechanism is the direct analogy; which a simple and direct comparison between two things. For example, you can compare a butterfly to an airplane. Then reflect on what ways are a butterfly and an airplane alike? The third type of analogy mechanism is the symbolic and metaphorical analogy; and this happens when we make an unexpected connection between words and thoughts to show primarily relational information. The last type of analogy mechanism is the fantasy analogy where by imagination we can stimulate unusual and powerful ideas. All these mechanisms, if used more intensively in our society, are expected to bring different waves of an inspiration economy. In the last few decades studies have confirmed that almost every child is creative at birth, but soon after they enter school, their creative potential becomes harder to reach; since their logical and analytical thinking will be in control. The more we go through formal education, we gradually slip into the restrictive domain of traditional thought. It is in this sense that our analytical training and education restricts our creativity. We become too logical, and thus our inspiration becomes even more difficult to occur. Our rich emotional and imaginative resources are largely neglected during education and devalued in most situations after graduation; it is time we allow school children to think freely, imagine, create their own future and most of all be inspired through analogical thinking.

5.27	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY AND BLOOMS THINKING
An inspiration economy is based on a knowledge economy (KE), since without a KE there will not be an appreciation of knowledge that changes socio-economic measures and gains. Moreover, KE practices are related to Benjamin Bloom‚Äôs classification of levels of intellectual behaviour with relevance to the process of learning. Different authors including the main editor of this handbook believe that after a KE the world might progress into a Learning Economy, where the differentiation and the power of the socio-economy will be based on the ability to learn.

Bloom‚Äôs learning scale contained three overlapping domains: the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. These domains are very important for the intensity of inspiration. Each of these domains had a level of activities and/or practices. Bloom identified, for example, the cognitive domain by six levels, all of them are related to the frequency and intensity of inspiration and these are: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. If we study Bloom‚Äôs thinking model we will see that it involves logical thinking and reasoning, including skills such as comparison, classification, sequencing, cause/effect, patterning, webbing, analogies, deductive and inductive reasoning, forecasting, planning, hypothesizing and critiquing. This type of thinking is inspirational since it involves creating something new or original. It involves the skills of flexibility, originality, fluency, elaboration, brainstorming, modification, imagery, associative thinking, attribute listing, metaphorical thinking and forced relationships. The aim of creative thinking is to stimulate curiosity and promote divergence and these are all sources of inspiration. While critical thinking can be thought of as more left-brain and creative thinking more right-brain, only the integration of both hemispheres can create a source of inspiration. Inspiration will need at least three stages to occur as per Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy: analysis, synthesis and evaluation; in order to occur. Each level will need one or more different practices in order to attain its full potential. For example, for the level of Knowledge we might have to collect, describe, identify, list, show, tell, tabulate, define, examine, label, name, retell, state, quote, enumerate, match, read, record, reproduce, copy and/ or select in order to trigger inspiration. Examples for knowledge activities that might lead to inspiration are:¬†events, places, and vocabulary and key ideas. In an inspiration economy these activities and practices will be the actual currency that creates the real economic prosperity for a country or a society. Comprehension is another level of domain that helps to build and sustain inspiration. When we associate, compare, distinguish, extend, interpret, predict, differentiate, contrast, describe, discuss, estimate, group, summarize, order, cite, convert, explain, paraphrase, restate and trace; we are actually trying to trigger our capability to inspire or be inspired. Examples of comprehension can be seen in our striving to:¬†find the meaning, transfer, interpret facts, infer the causes and deal with the consequences. Application is a level that ensures that the inspiration cycle is realised. Through applying the activities as: applying, classifying, changing, illustrating, solving and demonstrating; we are actually enhancing our chances to capture opportunities. Part of the application that will help enhance our ability to discover the hidden spots in our life will be calculating, completing, solving, modifying, showing, experimenting, relating, discovering, acting, administering, collecting, computing, constructing, determining, developing, establishing, preparing, producing, reporting, teaching, transferring and using. In this level we can use information in different situations to solve problems.

Analysis is another level that ensures creation of inspiration. In this level we analyse, arrange, connect, divide, infer, separate, classify, compare, contrast, explain, select, order, breakdown, correlate, draw a diagram, discriminate, focus and illustrate in order to have inspiration. Examples of sources of inspiration that might come from this practice are when we are¬† recognizing, explaining patterns and relating meanings. It is a stage when we start to think empathetically, when we start to see the parts and the whole. When we perform the practices of Synthesis it means that we will be able to combine, compose, generalize, modify, invent, plan, substitute create, formulate, integrate, rearrange, design, speculate, rewrite, adapt, anticipate, collaborate, compile, devise, express, facilitate, reinforce, structure in order to create inspiration that will influence the economy. Also during synthesising we are building up our ability to undertake inspiration through intervention, or negotiation, reorganisation and validation. Sources of such inspiration will be when we discuss ‚Äúwhat if ‚Äù situations, create new ideas, predict and draw conclusions.

Evaluation is also an important level of inspiration that is relevant to Bloom‚Äôs model. It is based on assessing, comparing, deciding, discriminating, measuring, ranking, testing, convincing, concluding, explaining, grading, judging, summarizing, supporting, appraising, criticizing, defending, persuading, justifying and reframing. All these examples create inspiration:¬†make recommendations, assess value, make choices and critique ideas. Attributes such as interpersonal relations, emotions, attitudes, appreciations, values, attempts, challenges, disputes, judges, contributions and praises are sources of inspiration that will add value to the socio-economy. Through the utilisation of Bloom‚Äôs dimensions and levels we can create our targeted society to be more proactive and with many focused initiatives creating inspiration that supports a learning based economy. The practices of a learning economy helps to overcome fear and lack of context, and thus make it easier for many concepts to be integrated, and also more possible to see the blind spots in the decision making process. In search of learning performativity of learning is created, and thus people become more persistent. In the journey of learning curiosity and seeking understanding, finding meanings leads to focused reflections that create inspiration again. As shown in Figure (5-4) an inspiration economy can be based on some of Bloom‚Äôs levels of learning that establish a learning economy where prior knowledge can be a source of inspiration, while application and synthesis help to enhance the wave of inspiration.

5.28	 INSPIRATION OUT OF NEEDS
Inspiration always has been attached to needs not wants. Without real needs we would not have witnessed many inspirations in humanity today. Entrepreneurs in Gaza for example, created their inspiring ideas out of deep needs. Due to Gazans mobiles are considered to be the lifelines to the outside world; any project for keeping their communication tools working and charged is considered to be a critical need. However, Gazans had to cope with about four hours of electricity a day, after the last war between Hamas and Israel. Due to such a situation and urgency of need four Gaza entrepreneurs created a device called ‚ÄòWalk and Charge‚Äô, which can successfully produce an electric charge from a small device that sits in shoes. Despite all the challenges in Gaza today there is a growing tech community that is inspired and sustained by a combination of donor money, a growing commitment from investors, and the passion of the entrepreneurs themselves. Entrepreneurs in the West Bank operate under difficult conditions, but this is what is unique about their inspiration. Since the West Bank was under the Israeli Occupation it is still difficult to operate a mobile network. Thus, companies can buy better connections by various means inside their offices, but this is still expensive. There is also damage done by the¬†international donor community which has responded to the decades-long conflict. Some young people just prefer to work in the private sector and they became ‚ÄúDonor funding dependent‚Äù or job seekers instead of job creators. Israel‚Äôs efforts to control Hamas, in power in Gaza, have resulted in a new economic ‚Äòstrangulation‚Äô of the population. The youth unemployment rate among the¬† population of 1.8 million¬† is 60%, according to the World Bank. Therefore, any Inspiration that comes out of this needs to have a clear affect and there is no other way, but to increase self-made entrepreneurs in Gaza. This means we need to lay the foundation for an economy that is ready to be a part of the global community and does not depend on perishable resources, but rather is self-reliant and inspires human capital. Many economies have grown today and become strong over the years because of real needs. Japanese needs for the electro-mechanical industry has created its strong automotive industry that we see today. The same is the need for Cambodia‚Äôs shift from agriculture to a more production based industry, which has created an entrepreneurs haven. Silicon Valley success stories are a collection of needs of the giant companies, the investors, and the growth of world global internet citizens. So, understanding and utilising needs will be one of the best enablers for future competitive inspiration.

5.29	 ROLE OF LIFELONG LEARNING IN INSPIRATION
Lifelong Learning (LLL) as a concept is multi-dimensional that, in principle, encompasses economic, social and personal dimensions (Biesta, 2006). Leamnson (2002) sees LLL as helping to build a combination of two abilities about problem solving (called procedural knowledge) and explaining how things are done (called declarative knowledge). Therefore, it is believed that LLL is about the development of behavioural knowledge abilities, i.e. it cannot be simply transmitted in classrooms or teaching, but rather on both collective and reflective efforts. LLL is found to facilitate the development of metacognitive and self-directed learning skills, such as the ability to work autonomously. Brookfield (1986) found that LLL teaching methodologies are based on problem-based learning, intentional learning environments, and cognitive apprenticeship. Moreover, LLL is found to be like a cycle of inspiration where a willing to learn comes when there is a reason to learn, whether it was for employability or being afraid of unemployment or a way to have more enjoyment (Evans 2003).

Inspiration that comes from LLL depends on learning pace and time with the learner in charge of them. Learning as a source of inspiration depends on building usable knowledge with a clear purpose that helps in self-managing, communication, information sharing, learning, performance improvement and problem solving. The early ‚Äô90s of the previous century shows a consistent growth in the spread of Lifelong Learning (LLL) as a means for inspiring societies. The organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) adopted a continuing education strategy as a means for social cohesion and inspiration since the beginning of this century (Rubenson, 2006 and Lee, 2001). At the same time, the World Bank group endorsed the LLL concept as a means for enhancing opportunities to meet labour market demands in a knowledge economy. Lifelong Learning (LLL) is seen today as a philosophy that believes it is never too late for learning and thus to be inspiring and be inspired. Since learning is a continuous process to be achieved through the life span of an individual or society, the same is seen for inspiration. Today LLL is seen more than just an educational tool, but rather an important inspirational instrument for meeting a dynamic economy throughout the life journey. LLL therefore constitutes three elements that make it a unique inspiring concept in both frequency and intensity as it focuses on: learning, life and length. According to Knapper (2006) LLL means that continuous and effective learning is practiced as a natural process that might involve social activity and mostly depends on self-directed individual initiatives. The sustainable acquisition of knowledge and the requirement for acting on it that the practices of LLL creates in our life, leads to more opportunities of both intentional and unintentional engagement for personal and professional fulfilment and thus it improves the quality of our lives. LLL can be seen as input for inspiration, or part of the inspiration process or a causality that leads to inspiration as per Figure (5-5).

In an unstable economic, political and social world; where competitiveness, innovation and sustainable change make a difference; LLL is seen as an important inspiring tool (Dunlap and Grabinger, 2003). LLL is found to indirectly influence people to optimise their capacity for self-direction, discovering their potential and create for them a metacognitive awareness. Smith and Spurling (2001) mentioned the LLL influence on psychology, economics, anthropology, sociology and the existence of a new culture where individuals seek and have the commitment to learn for both personal reasons besides their commitment to society or the family. Therefore, it is important to understand LLL and inspiration definitions. Lifelong Learning (LLL) is very important to the development of humanity. With LLL we become more self-empowered and minimise the turbulent life situations and thus there will be more opportunities to be inspired. With LLL we can redesign, or adjust life‚Äôs goals while fulfilling new knowledge. Inspiration occurs when attitudes change and more economical gains occur due to the quality of life achieved from new learning and the capacity built. With LLL people feel they are more accountable and thus sustain self-motivation. As many developed countries populations are ageing, LLL is considered both a challenge and an opportunity for an inspiration economy. Compared to previous times, this generation of older people and senior citizens is fitter and healthier than ever, which means people are living longer through more active lives. The aging group of the last two decades have built up a lifetime of experience and wisdom, which makes it a resource for inspiration that any country simply cannot ignore.

5.30	 INSPIRATION THROUGH EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIP
Effective partnerships based on synergy that start with the concept of a win-win situation have been an inspiring source of many leading world class organisations. With effective partnership, the learning possibilities increase the ability to facilitate more practical cooperation activities on themes of mutual interest. Partnerships offer numerous inspiration possibilities for staff, organisations and societies through influencing them to share experiences, solve challenges and build joint projects that enhance competitiveness or create innovation. Today inspiration based partnerships are growing among young entrepreneurs and family business which surely have a positive impact on the socio-economy. With partnership, from multi sectors, or affiliation from international partners and/or companies or even start-ups, can embrace a range of responsibilities, or face different challenges. Thus with such inspiring partnership we can bridge scientific fields with other research or practitioner based fields. This type of inspiration leads to a better probability of outcomes.

With synergy partnership conflicts can be avoided. Inspiration based on partnership is found to raise the possibility for open cooperative and assertive practices. For an inspiration economy to occur we need to be more accommodating and collaborative, instead of just competing or avoiding, as per figure (5-6), this shift can only be enhanced through effective partnership.

From the results of partnerships we can create more compromising abilities that shift towards being more inspired, as shown in figure (5-6), and thus help to satisfy all the concerned parties. Collaborating is one of the best inspiring partnership styles, since it helps people to be assertive concerning mutual interest. Compromising is a middle ground style of partnership that seeks to find a mediation to partially satisfy both parties.

5.31	 UNDERSTANDING THE MINDS OF THE INSPIRED
Those who are working to inspire the world, their community, organisations, relatives and most importantly themselves, are called a source of inspiration. What is unique about them? They believe they can do it. The inspired are all resemblances of Ghandi, where they all say in their heart, mind and spirit with a loud and clear voice ‚Äúwe must be the change we wish to see in the world‚Äù! They are unique in a way because they believe, in order to do great change, they have to follow Churchill‚Äôs wisdom ‚ÄúThe price of greatness is responsibility‚Äù; which drives them towards envisioning the importance of realizing their ideas through implementation and persistence to achieve them. Some of the inspired can be called mentors, since they are a consistent source of inspiration, others can be just a source of inspiration due to their perseverance stories and consistent achievements. The Oxford Dictionary named a person who inspires or influences others as ‚ÄúLuminary‚Äù. This is especially true for those who are prominent, an authority or a term of reference in a particular sphere. The mind of those who represent a source of inspiration for others is built around: ‚Äúwhat I need to make a difference in the gap I am observing and in the opportunity I have discovered?‚Äù In another stage, the mind of the inspired might be about ‚ÄúHow do I make a legacy?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat would make me provide direction and a sense of meaning to others?‚Äù In the last stage of inspiration, the mind of the inspired will be about ‚ÄúHow to sustain me being a feeling of hope?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow to motivate others to achieve what I achieved?‚Äù The inspired person has a challenge, since s/he is in a continuous mission to realize their capacity. He or she knows they have to cross at sometime all the boundaries, manage the challenges of cultures and religions in order to develop a vision of the possible. The luminary of those who inspire the world, as per Oxford Dictionary, is that they are really a breath of fresh air to the world and most of all to themselves.

5.32	 HOW SMART ORGANISATIONS TURN ON INSPIRATION
So many companies fail to implement the experience and insight they have worked so hard to acquire. The gap between knowing and doing is the first thing that confronts those organisations that try to turn knowledge about how to improve performance into actions that produce measurable results. Pfeffer and Sutton (2006), identified the causes of the knowing-doing gap by reviving and optimising what knowledge we acquire. Knowledge is found to be a source of inspiration if put into action using proper planning, analysis, meetings and presentations that can inspire further better deeds. Companies that act on their knowledge also eliminate fear, abolish destructive internal competition, measure what matters, and help their leaders to understand to realise the core values of their organisations. Overcoming the knowing-doing gap will resonate with executives everywhere who struggle daily to make their firms both know and do what they know. Smart organisations today focus on immersive research and analysis that can turn knowledge into creative consultative strategies and focused proactive projects and/or initiatives. Through capacity vs. demand creation, smart organisations lead a process of behavioural change in targeted customers or a population and thus this creates for them brand positioning as a reference in being total creative solutions companies.

6.1	 KNOW WHAT IS YOUR VALUE IN THE MARKET?
We have never read a lifetime story of any inspiring characters without seeing that they started inspiring themselves about how much value they are worth in the market. Now, and due to many repeated coincidences one even appreciates what many inspiring leaders say about writing themselves ‚Äì a cheque of millions of dollars and dating it with a certain date. It is a status where you are inspired to visualise what your real value is in the market once you appreciate your potential. The amount written in such cheques are more a type of revolution on oneself ‚Äôs constraints than just a materialistic value. Writing an empty account cheque resembles your trust in yourself and that you can make it.

If you do not evaluate yourself every now and then, surely you would be going much slower than you would possibly be. Not knowing our real differentiation and value to the market, to the society or even to the world, might manage to make you still be successful, but surely would be putting you off achieving lots of targets, and strain your potential, thus prevent you from creating a major influence in the world. Without valuation of yourself you are tying your spirit from possibilities and might be also losing a lot of opportunities. Possibilities are things that may or may not happen, while opportunities things we can make if they did not occur. Possibilities are given, while opportunities are made. We can increase our value in the market through creating or capturing opportunities and in the same time creating in ‚Äòour mind‚Äô the possibilities. This would be clearer for us once we continuously evaluate ourselves. Once you know and believe that your value is much more than the value of the market of your professional qualifications or trade, you will appreciate the comprehensive goodwill within you more than anything else. Sometimes, even if it is the spirit and the visualisation of what to be or the sound of ‚ÄúCan Do‚Äù, make also a real difference in your value and this in the end still can take to new heights. Success stories tell us not to neglect the viability of our spirit. One needs to always pay attention to what is not working, rather than what is working only, these are areas of early possible opportunities. If one keeps assessing the spirit of readiness this will help to pull its realised value further and further. Sometimes even a bit of humiliation can help us to be a wake up for re-evaluating ourselves thus calibrating our value. A world class inspiration programme, once it starts to spread within a society or country, will help to increase self-value and self-worth, while harmonising our socio-economic factors.¬†Any inspiration initiative will help to build a better business model that sustains inspiration for a long time.

6.2	 INSPIRATION NEEDS A GENERIC LIFE PLAN
We cannot claim that we have come through many inspirations that come as a result of a life time, however, we cannot see either that any inspiration will have come without at least a generic life plan. If you notice, much of the pain that we experience in the journey of inspiration comes actually from having an unstructured visualized life plan that have fallen to be properly forecasted and accurately achieved. However, for inspiration to occur usually it will not be attached only to a life plan, rather it would evolve as we move and discover ourselves and the world around us.

It is expected that the importance of a life plan will become so spread at an educational level once an inspiration economy is established, since the complexities of life will be increasing too. Life plans will be based on both intrinsic and extrinsic motivated milestones. However, what will differentiate a country economy from the other will be the ability for understanding the intrinsic motivations better than others. This needs a continuous development of authenticity through self-reflection that are imbedded again in the generic life plan of reference. A generic life plan will lead to consistent inspiration that will be passed on three profound pillars of attention, interpretation and memory. Only through the presence of these three pillars, planned inspiration will be triggered. With attention, interpretation and memory; clarity will come later in the journey of inspiration. Clarity may come in the beginning or the middle of the journey, but surely with clarity we can sustain inspiration and even grow in its intensity. With clarity we can gain focus, however this will not come at the beginning of our life plan. The fuzziness of a journey is a main characteristic of an inspiration based journey, once it commences. As we sail towards an unknown field, fuzziness will come and go at different frequencies and in different times of our life. Fuzziness represents an auto soul and/or self-search exercise that influences us to pause and reflect which enhances our ability to contribute to life and to our socio-economy. Once past the fuzziness stage, step by step we will reach a stage of attention. Interpretation of what is observed or focused on creates for us a level of advanced awareness that triggers our memory more and more. Through attention we can re-visit many things we did not realise clearly, due to the high area of blind spots in our life journey. We can see the goodness within us, the value added we can create and the beauty of many things or many people we disregarded before. Zig Ziglar once mentioned the two meanings of F-E-A-R, for normal people and how it blocks our life plan inspirations. Ziglar said that F-E-A-R is usually seen as short for Forget Everything And Run, but for those with a generic inspiring life plan it is about Face Everything And Rise to the circumstance and the opportunities around you. The choice is yours!

6.3	 INSPIRATION AND PRESSURE OF LIFE
Being an assessor and a jury member for many World Class, Excellence, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Awards; besides acting as a lean thinking expert in the last 20 years, one has to appreciate how the pressure of the tough times has managed to inspire people. Lean is about illuminating waste in one‚Äôs life and surroundings, this illumination starts only if we are dissatisfied with our life situation. Many individuals, organisations and societies development comes with new ways of business and/or new ways of achievement due to pressures in life. Through having our capacities and not our needs fulfilled, the pressure of life‚Äôs demands can be a real source for success.

If you do not have real pressures in your life create one. It is good to have natural adrenaline increase every now and then in our life, otherwise our life would be dull. One should use dreams and desires to achieve a restoration of what is supposed to be continuous inspiration. Once used to this restoration behaviour, you are really moving from a ‚Äúlevel of determination‚Äù to a ‚Äúlevel of dedication‚Äù towards a dream that will sustain inspiration. Once you manage to use your desire to consume energy towards first what motivates you to invest and then build your capacity to be inspired, you are set towards being a source of inspiration for the whole world, starting with society. This all happens through managing life pressures to one‚Äôs advantage. Many believe that by keeping such a commitment creates unnecessary pressures on one‚Äôs life. However, short term pressures are found not to affect true happiness. True happiness is longterm, deep measure of people‚Äôs genuine wellbeing that is appreciated first and utmost by people.

6.4	 TOWARDS AN ECONOMY THAT ESTABLISHES A ‚ÄòQUALITY OF LIFE‚Äô
Although an economy based on a high ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô that makes people happy may sound revolutionary, Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, enshrined the pursuit of happiness, in the early years of the 1800s, as a human right when he drafted the¬†Declaration of Independence. Jefferson emphasized that the objective of good government was ‚Äúto secure the greatest degree of happiness possible for the general mass of those associated under it‚Äù. Likewise, the Constitution of the United States¬†declares that government is to promote, among other things, the general welfare of the people. Thus, a value added economy would be clearly about ‚Äπquality of life‚Ä∫. Today, as civilisation needs to develop in its outcome to meet or out pass the fast speed of technology, we need to re-establish the principles of a ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô. We are in need more and more today to understand that ‚Äúeach of us need all of us‚Äù and ‚Äúall of us need each of us‚Äù. These are basic principles in an inspiration based economy. If you do not try to always inspire others, you will not be inspired and you will be economically poor. Life teaches us that legacy heroes do more than simply inspire us. These guru‚Äôs make things look easy, this how they manage to be inspired and at the same time create waves of inspiration in societies. Once we understand the making of inspiration stamina as illustrated in the figure (6-1); things would look easy and it would convince us to want to create more and more inspiration waves.

People in many developed countries are enjoying the real value of the ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô compared to richer people in many developing countries, because in the first case people in developed countries depend on the intrinsic ‚Äúqualities‚Äù of oneself to build up their fate in life. While unfortunately, in the second case, in may be the developing rich oil countries, people try to buy or acquire what they believe are the ‚Äòqualities of life‚Äô that are in the end totally dependent on extrinsic materialistic resources. An inspiration based economy will not allow the second model to control the communities life, since for an inspiration economy ‚Äòbetter life‚Äô means working our way towards stability and sustainability. For a ‚Äòbetter life‚Äô we need more sustained efforts towards life mission clarity supported by practices of transparency, integrity, accountability, co-existence, equal opportunity, vibrant non-governmental based organisations and civil rights transformation movements. In parallel to these practices and conditions, societies living a ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô would enjoy an inspirational, innovative, entrepreneurial and open environment that would always challenge the capacity of human potential. History shows that ‚ÄòQuality of Life‚Äô has been accomplished before by primarily changing the norms and/or adopting semi-flexible national policies. Any new economy delivering improved well-being should be established largely by active citizenship that will choose to invest more time in building a nation with increasingly enlightened values. Everyone‚Äôs quality of life, from today‚Äôs parents to future generations of great grandchildren, depends upon individuals collectively working to build a new economy based on the concept of genuine wealth. In his award-winning book,¬† Economics of Happiness: Building Genuine Wealth, ecological economist Mark Anielski explains the practical approach of building a more human friendly socio-economy environment grounded in what people value most: ‚ÄúLove, meaningful relationships, happiness, joy, freedom, sufficiency, justice and peace‚Äù. These constructs of the qualities of life open vital blind spots of future economic development that keep us away from an economy based on just material possessions.

6.5	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY ‚Äì INDIA AS AN EXAMPLE
India is considered the future super power with an average 7% growth in the last 20 years. India differentiates its growth through the impact of development at a human level, through processes that utilise different inspiration techniques to reach the most suitable position for today. Since Ghandi, through policies that started with Jawaharlal Nehru‚Äôs government, India has been consistent with its goals, one of which is to inspire the population to be more effective and productive through a transparent democratic process that survives based on co-existence.

Nehru popularised the term ‚Äúscientific temper‚Äù in India where national scientists were able to think independently, understand and practice scientific methods in their daily lives, analyse and take informed and calculated decisions rather than just taking statements at their face value without challenging the depth of decisions. This process differentiates India from other emerging economies, including China. This is a guaranteed path towards an ‚Äòinspiration economy‚Äô, which is about inspiring the human sole and not better materialistic achievements. India is considered a good model for an inspiration economy, since it has managed to create major development through certain inspirational practices in an atmosphere of diversity, cultural sects, superstition, and multi-religions. Besides the uniqueness of Indian inspiration it has sustained its development in spite of having the majority of the population living in poverty, but this surely verifies economic strength based on realised developments and not on petrodollars or faked non sustainable gain. India is still striving to build a culture of universalism based on healthy scepticism, freedom from prejudice or bias, objectivity, open mindedness and the ability to accept humility to enhance learning. However, this journey of striving to towards such universalism is what differentiates the inspiration journey in India and enhances its willingness to build evidence based judgements, rationality, perseverance and a positive approach to failure.

6.6	 SCIENTIFIC METHOD‚ÄôS ROLE IN CREATING WAVES OF INSPIRATION
There are scientific methods for creating inspiration. One of the main characteristics of such a method is the ability to raise questions, collect background information, construct hypotheses, design experiments, analyse data and draw conclusions about an inspiration path or plan. Through well approached inspiration plans, we can create inspiration and show a person how he/she can raise his/her ability to make constructive contributions. These contributions, once released, can help to create around them group discussions and bring out the use of the most suitable scientific method for creating inspiration for a specific group or setting. Research helps us to be inspired by disclosing ‚Äúthe‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù about people and life. Through research we can share values and identify areas of common concern that are of relevance to human thought and behaviour. Sigmund Freud was inspired by scientific methods and this reflected clearly in his book ‚ÄòThe Interpretation of Dreams‚Äô (published in 1899) which became famous in different parts of the world. Freud believed that there is a specific psychological technique through which dreams can be interpreted. Jean Piaget was also inspired by scientific methods as a ‚ÄòDevelopmental Psychologists‚Äô. Inspired by the work of Binet on intelligence testing, Piaget undertook studies to understand the development that takes place among children from infancy to adulthood. Abraham Maslow used scientific methodology to explain how people are motivated to address survival needs through physical and emotional well-being, while Freud used scientific methods to explore the unconscious mind. Both Maslow and Freud managed to instruct through this method the state of quiet, unreflecting self-observation, and to report whatever internal observations were made. Freud‚Äôs techniques sparked a major change in how mental illness was viewed; by suggesting that not all psychological problems have physiological causes; his belief that mental problems could be resolved by actually talking about them, inspired the development of a new discipline in psychotherapy. Physical development, deals with the changes in the body while personal development means the changes in an individual‚Äôs personality. On reflection to such waves of inspiration to the disciplines of psychology we know that social development refers to changes in the way an individual relates to others. For an inspiration wave to occur it requires assimilation, accommodation and equilibration. These can be undertaken through understanding the condition of the applied situation first and then managing the expectations, experiences and perceptions that are suitable.

Scientific methods have been found to inspire both inductive and deductive thinking. With ‚Äòdeductive research‚Äô one is inspired to use the reasoning and the ‚Äútop-down‚Äù approach, i.e. moving from seeing the general problem to focusing on the particular problem. While ‚Äòinductive research‚Äô works the opposite way, i.e. moving from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories which is called the ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù approach. The researcher begins with specific observations and measures, detects patterns and regularities, formulates some tentative hypotheses to explore, and finally develops some general conclusions or theories. Inductive reasoning is more open-ended and exploratory in nature, thus it provides more possibility to inspire the researcher and those involved with it even during the early stages. Deductive reasoning research is however found to be narrower and is generally used to test or confirm hypotheses. Thus it is used to confirm inspiration doubt. Most social research, however, involves both inductive and deductive reasoning throughout the research process. Science can be an inspiration if there are relations between training and organized commonsense. It more similar to music and astrology which are full of inspiration mixed with fun. Once scientific research is integrated with openness and flexibility; originality of knowledge can be guaranteed. Socrates new this earlier, hence he adopted the method of doubt, due to the probability that inspiration can be much larger.

6.7	 HOW TO CREATE INSPIRATION?
Inspiration will not happen suddenly, without a prepared background inspiration will not come out of nowhere. Even in the case of Einstein, inspiration came after focused and persistent searching and reading that lead to a visualisation that constructively built relativity theory was reflected later in mathematical formulas. Inspiration requires producing new cultural and artistic expressions, while others are experiencing culture and the arts by attending musical or dramatic events or by reading fiction, poetry or other forms of creative writing. Programmes such as the UK ‚Äòreading nation‚Äô are found to be a source to help create inspiration. Reading for pleasure was the most commonly reported activity. A study shows that up to 55% of British citizens read works of fiction, including novels, plays and short stories (with the majority doing so at least once a week), 25% read biographies and 6.5% read poetry. This is the differentiation of the level and intensity of inspiration.

So, inspiration will not come from convergent thinking, even though this thinking dominates most of the areas of our available brain information, i.e. our fixed paradigm and knowledge about how things should be. Actually, only through overcoming convergent thinking one can reach the level of awareness about knowing where things are and only then can inspiration occur. Through overcoming convergent thinking we manipulate our experience about where things might be. But, if we want to come to this tightly controlled thinking we also need to recognise that something may be opposite to all of this, as without this breakthrough our inspiration will be limited. Inspiration requires that we discover something that might be not accepted by convergent thinking or seen as totally wrong or not relevant. Thus the shift toward more divergent thinking will be newly created inspiration. If we manage to introduce divergent thinking across borders within our minds, then we start to be more and more an inspiration spirit, as often as we want!

As we start inspiration divergent information enables us to move more towards deeper spaces in our mind, and we start to feel the fuzziness of not knowing where to go. Once we feel we are suspended in air, more inspirational ideas come and go. You will get the feeling in the beginning that you might have done an evil act or this does not really make sense, or a feeling that you want to go back to your safe zone (inside the box again!). Even at this moment you will realise this stupidity. This feeling of emptiness is psychologically very painful and reflects the feeling of fuzziness again. Once you maintain your persistence in this most difficult and critical area, you will start new fresh air coming your way, telling you to hold on, since there is something behind this. Then you realise that what you experienced is normal, since we have not been trained to manage the pain of escaping a fixed thinking box. Actually, we have been trained most of our life to the opposite, i.e. how specific steps solve a problem. Actually, you are told directly and indirectly that you are not brilliant or you do not have fast thinking, if you do not have forward thinking, similar to logical trouble shooting. Yet, inspiration comes most of the time not through long thinking, but radical reverse thinking. Evidence suggests that inspiration can come from the exhibition of arts, photography or sculpture. This type of inspiration can support creating long and reverse thinking which is much more than deep thinking, it is a source of inspiration creativity. With long and/or reverse thinking you will be reading and contributing to knowledge or the socio-economy with high quality of production, i.e. you will have a very competitive outcome. For example, an inspiration might occur with long and/or reverse thinking, as you are reading, or with situations of high enjoyment such as writing poetry, seeing a well painted picture, meditating with nature, or even listening to well-read scripts full of wisdom, relaxing with specific music, or witnessing a scientific discovery that will change the face of humanity for ever. These moments and types of enjoyment can lead us to reflect on specific areas of accumulated knowledge and tickle our minds with hormones that cause inspiration. The association of feelings and ideas that come from a long thinking journey with a new wave of thinking is what makes us have inspirational thoughts and ideation. Thus the more we bridge the gap for innovations in areas where they have never been explored, or applied before, the more we can play the whole game differently. This type of process helps humans go beyond the normal cycle of innovation, or even development, to areas we do not dare to think about. It is a feeling and spirit when combined leads us to start restoring our capabilities to fly with our dreams, thus giving belief in our ability to discover and change to the betterment of ourselves and society. It is simply an awakening of our hidden potential and strengths. It is in this area where we see ourselves to be more of open minded and affluent with alternatives around us. It is in this area where you will appreciate that inspiration is about finding answers to what we are looking for and it is also the secret power of our daring to select only one of these answers.

When we reach a high level of inspiration we feel as if we have landed on a new planet. The value of this inspiration at this time will still be meaningless to us, since we have come to an area that we still do not appreciate until we see its outcome. It is difficult to value the feelings of inspiration moments, since we have not been trained to appreciate the value of thinking ‚Äòout of the box‚Äô, like inventors or innovators. The limited value you feel is like saying ‚Äúsurely someone else has thought about this before‚Äù, and this makes you quickly lose your inspiration moments. We need inspiration to create an environment that will maintain our dignity, to overcome our ego and sometimes make us feel humility; in order to codify our differentiations as social human and spiritual beings with unique contribution(s) in this journey called life.

6.8	 INSPIRATION MENTORSHIP
Inspiring Mentors are usually 1 in a 1,000. The mentor can be your father, mother, son or daughter or your wife or even your friend or teacher. Inspiring mentors usually know that one of the best ways to sustain or generate inspiration is to be a role model for their followers.¬†The more you surround yourself with such people the more you are going to reach the level of inspiration that reflects your surroundings. With sincere mentorship we can live towards our dreams gradually and in a sustainable way.¬† Whether we choose to follow the mentor‚Äôs directions or not, living towards our meaningfulness in life is an important part of accumulating the energy for sustained inspiration. With proper mentorship we will always realign our focus to what matters, in creating a legacy in life. Mentors are good in helping us to sort our priorities, shift our focus, drive us towards achievements, and most of all remind us to be humble during the peak of recognition. Thus with mentorship we can preserve our energy potential to the next stage and be oriented to future milestones and dreams.

It is said that going through inspirational mentorship is like using pencils. It takes a lot to absorb and sustain giving and taking inspiration. Pencils will be able to do many great things, as inspirational mentorship, but need to be sharpened from time to time, as our souls, minds, hearts and spirits do. However, as pencils, we are also supposed to learn from mentors and do not hesitate to try and correct any mistakes. No matter what the condition, mentors will usually try to influence us to contribute to the last moment of our lives. In order to benefit from mentorship and receive moments of inspiration, we have to be lean, thus keep up to the mark no matter how difficult the situation is. As pencils, we should allow other human beings to access our potential for the many gifts we possess. We have to let the mentors see the continuous and accumulated experiences to see how to sharpen these from time to time. By going through the various problems and challenges of life, mentors can help us be more value added creatures. Most important, as pencils, mentors will help us to be of value from the inside, hence we can leave our mark on every ‚Äúpoint‚Äù we come across in life.

6.9	 SPIRIT OF INQUIRY AND INSPIRATION
There are many ways to find inspiration, but there are few that will help sustain inspiration in a way that will change our life or contribution to the socio economy. The greater the variety of resources of inspiration in the world, the more we need to differentiate the way we capture, source, or capitalise on issues relevant to these waves of inspiration. Through these waves there can be a major milestone that will change our life journey, or even create a diversion to create a radical change in our fate. The sensitivity for inspiration differs as per the trait, experience, aptitude, attitude, paradigm of each of us. Positive people are usually sensitive to any type and/or source of inspiration. Such people easily embrace inspiration and appreciate it. Negative characters, however, are usually conservative about most types of inspiration sources, but once they experience them repeatedly, it will build their trust to accept them. Therefore, the frequency of inspiration is very important to ensure an affective impact. Inspiration is a way of life that is created by the specific process of thinking and method of acting. Inspiration comes with the build-up of a ‚ÄòSpirit of Inquiry‚Äô that leads to building a rational view of the world. With a spirit of inquiry, one can have a key input for factual based decision making. With inspiration one has a mindset that will be able to question and be questioned. In life we have few opportunities to discover ourselves, some opportunities come with natural incidents, other opportunities can be created by ourselves or by our mentors who have gone through the whole journey or at least most of it.¬†However, ‚ÄúLearning by Doing‚Äù and ‚ÄúAccelerated Learning‚Äù programmes are amongst the profound opportunities that have been evidenced based since Socrates till date. What differentiates these two opportunities is that they create the disruption needed for effective inspiration. Inspiration helps to discover the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit within us by building the opportunity to let us discover our potential through accepting ‚Äúfogginess as part of the journey‚Äù.

Inspiration requires that we do not listen to people in many parts of the journey of life, especially in the early stage for starting a new thing. The story of the boy, the man and the donkey is a good reflection of how inspiration might be controlled or terminated, if you only listen to what people say or believe. It is said that an old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they went along they passed some people who remarked it was a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding. The man and the boy thought maybe the critics were right, so they changed positions. Later, they passed some people who remarked, ‚ÄúWhat a shame, he makes that little boy walk.‚Äù They then decided they both would walk! Soon they passed some more people who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey. Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy and man said they were probably right, so they decided to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they lost their grip on the animal and it fell into the river and drowned (Ashliman, 2009). When inspiration happens one can forget about one‚Äôs life balance. Since creating a living balance between work and play and between seriousness and joy you rarely travel on an inspired journey as those who are inspired and become more persistent for the next stage in life.

6.10	 UNIQUE INSPIRATION NEEDS A REAL CHALLENGE
To be inspired you need to consider what you are doing now and whether you are really satisfied with what you are doing towards a lifetime achievement. If you are not enjoying what you are doing or you are just working for a paid job, there is a high chance that you are not going to create an inspiration that will affect the world around you. Yes this requires you to step outside of your comfort zone, but is this the safest road towards a realised inspiration. Once you have a challenge or need to develop something that will differentiate your routine life, surely you will become emotionally committed. The more you become involved the more you will start to visualise the journey you will make towards effective inspiration. Spiral inspiration requires challenges and failures and throughout this book you will see repetition of the issue of failure and its strong correlation with inspiration. One cannot even write a book about inspiration without mentioning the importance of having failure to enhance the level inspiration. Since with failures we move from the control of logical thinking to creative, analogical and reverse thinking. Today, you can say a rule of thumb is that failure inspires winners and failure defeats losers. Through failures we discover opportunities. The American billionaire John Rockefeller, once said, ‚ÄúI always tried to turn every disaster into an opportunity‚Äù. This why we would always say that your hit rate will increase and your ability to do proper forecasting will be more successful, when you reach a level where you are not afraid to lose.

History tells us that inspiration can be learned from obstacles, failures, challenges and focused repetitions. If you analyse the life of legends from Gandhi, to Omar, to Ibn Khuldoon, to Mandala, and recently Steve Jobs and Bill Gates you will notice a similarity in all these legends‚Äô paths. However, we will focus on Bill Gates‚Äô path, as he is a living legend. Bill Gates shows that he has been an unbeatable legacy in the 21st century when it comes to creating an impact and influence on the world. While Gates still is a normal human, his achievement surpasses any average human more than ten fold. Focusing on Gates‚Äô recent life model, it shows how an inspiration momentum spirals without failure. This spiral path Gates has managed to come through could not have been so inspiring without the excitement of failure and turning back.

If you refer to figure (6-2) you will notice that Gates‚Äô ‚ÄòInspiration Economy Waves‚Äô came with different forms and intensity in the last forty years or so. Gates started his journey as an inspired and inspiring student, until he could not continue and established and inspired Microsoft as a start-up company with a small team. Then, Bill managed to set a dream for having Microsoft software in every personal computer and with the concept of inspiring software abundance. By the time Microsoft controlled the PC software market, it became so inspiring an organisation to work for it raised its competitiveness compared to its rivals, especially Steve Jobs‚Äô Apple. As the inspiration waves of Gates became weakened, he started a journey to understand the world, and this inspiration wave was followed by another blow out when Bill and his company were attacked for software industry domination. In reaction to this there were legendary moves towards another lifetime mission, and Gates started to listen more closely and focused on essential world needs. Again another ‚Äúpull down‚Äù of this wave was when Microsoft and Bill Gates had a series of long trials when both were indicted and had to pay large compensations. What is unique about Bill Gates‚Äô story is that he insisted on changing history and continued his waves of inspiration by establishing one of the largest philanthropic non-profit organisations. This was followed by Bill announcing that it was time to leave the Microsoft leadership and work as a mentor, focusing on chronic human diseases. Later, Bill announced he had let go of ‚Öîrds of his fortune for the Bill and Malinda Non-Profit World Improvement Projects, including the unique focus on Healthcare and Education, especially the future schools that were established in cooperation with Microsoft. In the last 5 years, Bill and Warren Buffet have been leading a project called the ‚ÄòGiving Pledge Club‚Äô where the World‚Äôs top 100 billionaires pledge to give more than two thirds of their fortune away once they die and during their life. We hope with these examples of Bill Gates‚Äô life journey, we can show how the inspiration of just one person can create waves for the economy and society where almost all of them are positive!

Visits to museums, galleries and historical sites are supposed to be a major activity before retirement. Approximately 40% of all British adults made a visit to a museum or gallery at least once a year. Just over half of all visits were to a city or town of historic character, while about 40% of visits were to a historic park, garden or landscape. These types of visits were found to open the mind to life and what is the next stage of life. From this array of information it becomes clear that a majority of the population have an extensive and frequently intense involvement with culture as it is defined here. This involvement constitutes a significant proportion of leisure activity in the UK. It also indicates the extent to which the character of existence in the UK ‚Äì the quality of life and identity of its people ‚Äì is indelibly stamped with cultural and artistic engagement. Not only is the UK a world-leader in providing a context for civilised life, but it is the vibrancy of its culture and arts and the extent of popular engagement with them that largely make it so. One of the characteristics of an inspiration economy is the consistent change in the concept of retirement and its relevant environment. It would be difficult in such an economy to have early retirement from any job.

6.12	 NATIONAL VOLUNTEERS PROGRAMME AND INSPIRATION
Many leading countries today have started to realise the role of volunteering in creating positive inspiring waves within the community, thus supporting the local economy. National effective volunteer programmes begin with a volunteer recruitment programme that is well planned and executed on the promise to offer meaningful empowerment towards involvement in a society improvement activity. National volunteers programmes are found to inspire people to achieve their goals or explore there intrinsic powers. With national programmes long-term volunteering provides an opportunity towards moving forward in a better spirit of commitment and accountability that spans an extended period of time. Today other types of volunteering programmes, for example family volunteering programmes, provide volunteers with the opportunity to participate in a meaningful service while spending time with their families. Student volunteering programmes help schools and youth groups to gain valuable knowledge and skills. Another rising star today is what is called ‚Äòvirtual volunteering‚Äô which allows anyone to contribute their time and expertise without ever leaving their home. For many volunteer opportunities, you can work with an advisory team or conduct a survey to identify volunteer assignments that will help advance the goals of the programme. If you are working on a specific service project, you can determine your volunteer needs through developing a task list. Here you consider what you want to accomplish and the tasks needed; then create a comprehensive list of the assignments and the number of volunteers needed for each task.

6.13	 SELF-CONTROL AND AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY
Inspiration is like perfume, you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself. Inspiration has its own time, season and own reasons! You cannot ask it to stay, you can only embrace it as it comes and be glad that for a moment in your life it was yours! True inspiration does not have an ending. An inspired spirit always believes in the promise of inspiration, no matter how long the time and how far the distance. Inspiration is a mix of some of the best of yesterday and a sense of the future. Therefore, as long as we have memories, inspiration remains and as long as we have hope, inspiration comes. Inspiration spreads through friendship and professional colleagues, besides family and community. Inspiration comes from sharing, caring and forgiveness.

In an inspiration economy self-control will be the most important power with oneself. Individuals and societies are expected rationally to stick to their long term goals; however, as human beings we have limitation to will-power. Therefore, development of self-control is found to be the most precious concept that society leaders, government decision makers, social entrepreneurs and organisation stakeholders can develop for impacting any socio-economic targets. Studies show, for example, that not only people‚Äôs consumption expenditures fall sharply when they retire, but even they cannot maintain their quality of life standards. One reason for this is inspiration. Once people retire their mindset tells them they are useless. Self-control however, will help to overcome this negative psychology by enabling the retiree to realise a new way of contributions to life, may even better previous ones and more value based and not materialistic driven (Mullainathan and Gruber 2002). The existence of self-control problems does not mean that the rational choice approach has to be completely relinquished. One of the defining characteristics of human beings is that they are able to recognise their weaknesses and overcome them. This is where an inspiration economy plays a role. The more we manage to bring out this ability the more we will be able to see longer and deeper into the life time contributions of human beings. One of the most important anomalies that will help reduce the cost incurred when failing to create inspiration at the right time is to establish values of self-commitment. This selfcommitment usually needs individuals who are members of social institutions, since through such groups they will be more prone to be inspired to overcome their weaknesses (Frey and Eichenberger, 2001). In the case of retirement, one of the expected inspiration economy based solutions is inspiring those on the edge of retirement to set an after retirement plan. Apart from cognitive limitations, self-control requires decisive human decisions that are sometimes, or even most of the time, away from our constrained emotional thinking. Many people are inspired to a limit that fails only once they face situations where strong emotions are evident, and here you will see rational decisions are really strained. Over the last 20 years, the role of emotions in human decision making has been thoroughly studied by psychologists mainly Loewenstein and Lerner (2001). There are many studies that have identified for example the numerous effects of emotions on behaviour. Nevertheless, the relevance of emotions for a general model of (market) behaviour is not clear (Elster, 1999). The empirical studies show that one cannot isolate the emotional effects in economically relevant contexts. Many recent investigative studies show that one of the challenging self-control problems is to distinguish ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòbad‚Äô influences of emotions.

The view that all emotions are irrational could not be supported by the latest findings. The intentional oppression of emotions has been found can harm the individual ability to make a decision (Damasio,1994). In an inspiration based economy emotion‚Äôs role to change market outcomes will be continuously investigated.

6.14	 INSPIRATION: MOVING FROM INVOLVEMENT TO ENGAGEMENT
One of the dictionary definitions of¬†involvement¬†is ‚Äúto enfold or envelope,‚Äù whereas one of the meanings of¬†engagement¬†is ‚Äúto come together and interlock‚Äù. Thus, involvement implies ‚Äòdoing to‚Äô; in contrast, engagement implies¬†‚Äòdoing with‚Äô. Inspiration requires that people are engaged through techniques called Total People Involvement (TPI) and then follow and develop to a stage called Total People Engagement (TPE), where functional practices are motivated or challenged to be more emotional and passion driven and where social practices occur to higher community engagement.

If we inspire students to a level of a community shared programme, we need first to raise the accountability of the families to such inspiration based initiatives. This means we do not deal with parents as only clients, but as partners in building school programmes and part of the assessment team. This means parents will not be only volunteers for school open days as we are used to experience in most school programmes, but in fact they are stakeholders of school improvements. This is called an involvement level. It is of course beyond contacting the parents when there is a problem. Also, it is beyond worrying about blame that will only focus on areas where it is not fulfilling its results. When we come to the level of inspiring through total engagement then parents are part of the school-family with empathetic based relationships. Inspiring empathetic relationships means that the school is going to have focused listening, welcoming, and sharing of decision making with the parents. Practices involving parents and students can gain multiple benefits from programmes towards being successful in life, overcoming average grades or test obstacles, or even improving participative attendance, or enrolment in more challenging programmes that help discover the student‚Äôs potential or improve social skills; are expected and part of the norm. Such empathy based school-family relations also include addressing issues such as student quality of life, lifelong learning, health and safety, including affordable housing. These connections can also improve parents‚Äô feelings of efficacy and increase community support for schools. Movement from involvement towards engagement in school-family partnerships should not only help to raise student achievement, but in fact improve local community synergy. It is a transition from a school striving to bring families to identify pre-selected types of projects, needs, and goals and then telling parents how they can contribute; towards schools striving to engage parents with what they think, dream, and worry about. As you can see the goals of both are different. In the second, family engagement, the school will be striving not to ‚Äòserve clients‚Äô only, but in fact to ‚Äògain partners‚Äô. The meaning of empowering is connected with inspiring. Whether we talk about oneself, or others as students, citizens, families and communities; effective empowerment does not happen without proper engagement techniques that require a relationship-building process that starts with humble observations and listening. Engagement means we have schools without boarders when it comes to inspiration. One way to begin this process of engagement is that teachers start regular pre-arranged visits to students‚Äô homes. Also, schools might become even more advanced in inspiration practices to build collaboration projects with police, social development and local health centres or even the NGO‚Äôs within the community to create an inspiration profile that is more customised to special cases.

One of the benefits of engagement is to create what can be called a double loop inspiration cycle, since the school gains from the profound knowledge that parents have gained in more than 10 to 12 years of raising and dealing with their children. Learning curves can be synchronised between the school and parents to benefit from creating sources of customised inspirational breakthroughs to achieve their dreams and make them a reality. Part of the deep engagement is that school representatives act as good listeners and observers to respond to parents‚Äô concerns. Then, the school can work again with the parents to establish an ‚Äòinspiration plan‚Äô to encourage them to connect with one another and move towards broader action. One of the inspiring stories we have come across is how a school dealt with the issue of computer illiteracy of an immigrant family. The parents were impressed with the online literacy programme the school was using to help their son. The father expressed his wish about having the ability to understand computers and the Internet. The school teacher visiting the different families with similar backgrounds managed to attract other parents with similar interests and started a customised computer literacy programme. This story involves cycles of inspiration waves, between the students and the school, school and parents and most of all the total engagement between the parents and the community. Such an inspiration programme is unique and can create a culture that attracts the mindset for a new economy, since it triggers other projects. After the ‚Äòcomputer parent literacy‚Äô project started similar programmes called ‚ÄúParent University‚Äù commenced which a focus on learning about how schools operate. Parents came together with school staff and university representatives to develop a curriculum for monthly classes, which attracted as many as 100 parents, offered simultaneous courses including sessions on naturalization and citizenship, high school graduation requirements, and college readiness and financing. Once organisations are engaged they can continuously develop and deepen relationships among different entities in the community. Engagement therefore is an important source of inspiration since being engaged means you are willing to take responsibilities. For the school example, being engaged, means deeply bridging the work of society leaders with businessmen and NGO‚Äôs to tackle community based problems. This type of solidarity between school and society stakeholders has created success stories such as having schools preventing toxic incinerators being built nearby, approval for local affordable housing, or an increase in public safety in entire neighbourhoods. With engagement social capital inspires opportunities for societal and economic values building synergy among the targeted community and beyond. Engagement raises interest and optimism for change. Once this spirit is raised social capital will have better functional, emotional, and social influence followed by aspirational capacity.

In order for practices to move, from functional to emotional and then social, they have to address first the common good, carry a universal value and be a source for the advancement of society, as illustrated in figure (6-3). Then people would be inspired as they would feel they can suggest and/or create an impact in the advancement of a mission or create development to an environment or situation. Once we provide space for different perspectives to artistically and freely interact, we would see this engagement develop exponentially.

6.15	 THE ART OF CREATING INSPIRATION
In leading an inspiring organisation you will see that starting from the entry interview, the organisation might require a statement from its new staff about their vision in life and what they target to leave as a legacy. Inspiration is becoming more like art with emphasis on portfolios for personnel decisions in life, shifting from being a personal issue to an inspirational issue. What a person will try to do in their life journey, influences and stimulates many in society, leading organisations to articulate sharing such inspiration, visions or dreams. The basic requirement of creating inspiration to anyone including ourselves is to understand how learning is conceptualized. In an inspiration economy we prefer to track how learning is creating communities that facilitate and accelerate the learning cycle. In order to create inspiration we need to innovate by motivating people to read, travel, explore different contents and deal with inspiration as an art. Part of the ignition of inspiration occurs during the process of assessment and feedback which enhances the cycle of learning, especially if debated or challenged. It is therefore seen that our response to different situations of learning will also be a source of inspiration. This is why this double loop of inspiration is becoming more an art than management practice.

An inspiration economy can be realised in any society once the value of inspiring implemented ideas replaces the value of goods as the dynamo powering the economy. The world‚Äôs future economy, as many economists believe, lies in the level of inspiration and creative ideas that can measured by new patents and registered products. Thus, the greatest possible investments governments can make today for their citizens‚Äô future prosperity will be to create more sources of inspiration that make their people smarter and more innovative with intrinsic powers (Friedman 2009). Innovation and inspiration cannot be learned merely by copying, nor are there any rules for their practice. There is even a suspicion that universities can hinder innovative or inspirational spirits, as neither Steve Jobs nor Bill Gates graduated from college. It might be recognised that, regardless of discipline, scholarly research is by definition an attempt to modify an existing body of knowledge. In that case, innovation, is understood as the transformative mode of knowledge transmission, which can equally well be experienced in, or exemplified by, any field. To a certain extent, this is true. For example, freshman seminars at research universities can seek to inspire students at a beginner‚Äôs level by introducing the excitement of research in the different disciplines.

We always theorise that an Inspiration Economy is the result of the Innovation Economy and Learning Economy. Innovation and inspiration have been linked together for a long time. Without trying to innovate you will not be able to inspire. Therefore, today inspiration can affect innovation in education, research and development, society‚Äôs unity and besides all speed of economic development and recovery. Innovation and inspiration go along each other as they both search for opportunities and are particular with their interest. As we strive towards innovation and inspiration, we might sacrifice (for some time) our well-being for the sake of better achievement. Since inspiration is well linked with creativity and innovation by allowing one to think of new unconventional ways (Christensen et. al., 2010), inspiration boosts our abilities to challenge the impossible status and move it to a state where it will be more enjoyable and more possible to achieve. Today a rising star that has been a driving force for many inspiration driven projects, or with many start-ups, is called an ‚Äòecosystem‚Äô. An ecosystem is found to have a unique source of inspiration that depends on cultural heritage, traditions and practices. With an ecosystem we have more ability to engage with culture, besides more opportunities to create reflections.

6.17	 PRACTICING INSPIRATION ‚Äì SEEING THE PIG PICTURE
Inspiration is about the ability to see the big picture. Inspiration does not happen to anyone unless they can see their role in society or the group they belong to. Hence, inspiration needs consistently tools that support seeing and focusing on the big picture. Some people are able to see themselves as part of the great project of life, hence they deliver and develop as they try to meet their role, others miss the purpose of their existence, and therefore they have a real sustainable impact on their surroundings. Many of us remember the story of the middle ages, when a bishop was making the rounds, calling on parishes in his area. He came to a village where there was a great deal of building going on. Curious, he approached one of the workers asking, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù The man replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cutting stones.‚Äù The bishop continued, eventually coming upon another worker. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúMe?‚Äù said the worker, his voice brimming with pride, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm building a cathedral‚Äù. The difference in inspiration between both workers is very clear and obvious, one appreciates his role as a follower and one see his role as a partner in a large project. The second worker is inspired by a feeling rather than following an order. There is a profound difference here. To make our beloved ones, families, community and followers inspired with the spirit of entrepreneurship, we have to help them create and see their dreams to be more visible initially.¬†We have to describe in detail what the realized vision looks like. One of the good recent history examples of practicing inspiration on our communities or followers is the dream that the former US President¬†John F. Kennedy, shared in a speech to Rice University students, where he vividly described a moon landing that would take place more than five years after his death: ‚Äú‚Ä¶we shall send to the moon, 240,000 miles away‚Ä¶, a giant rocket‚Ä¶greater than the length of this football field‚Ä¶made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented‚Ä¶and then return it safely to earth, re-entering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour‚Ä¶and do all this, and do it right, and do it first, before this decade is out‚Äù. The ability of President Kennedy to draw the big picture for almost all American citizens triggered waves of inspiration that drove national efforts collectively, with a spirit of the ‚Äòeco-system‚Äô or entrepreneurship integrated with this dream and this is what really differentiated the US economy until today. Innovation once it meets the entrepreneurial spirit it will create an inspiration wave that defines different meanings for the life journey through enhancing simplicity and helping others make sense from complexity through focusing on values.¬†An ‚Äòeco-system‚Äô in practice influences our thinking away from focusing on ‚Äòthe how‚Äô during the inspiration process, rather to focus on ‚Äòthe what‚Äô and ‚Äòthe why‚Äô.

Inspiration can happen if we remind ourselves, or our followers, of the deeper values that underlie the things we do in the right time and moment. In her¬† 2011 Nobel Peace Prize lecture, Liberia‚Äôs President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf¬† described her actions to bring peace and establish values in her country, as a long lifetime journey to Oslo that was shaped by the values of parents, grandmothers, indigenous Liberians and farmers whom could not read or write. Inspiration as shown by Ellen has occurred through the taught and accumulated values of her life journey while maintaining her ability to continuously see the pig picture that is creating a major change in her world. People can be inspired by slogans they can repeat and it touches their heart that is easily recalled in the heat of the moment, this helps people to be inspired while they are in their daily decision-making, however this all will not happen if they lose their ability to see the pig picture of what they are going to achieve. Even when we boycott a product, or say yes or no for a specific thing, we are supposed to have done that based on our commitment to the goals ahead. This is used today in most marketing campaigns. Tolerating the differences and managing diversity can help to embrace different backgrounds, besides inspiring people to work together.¬†Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore and Mahathir of Malaysia managed to do that, more than 50 years ago, and made their countries a success story, just because they both were focused on and able to manage the country by seeing the big picture. There are many similar inspiring moments that happen when success and failure occurs. During failures people usually take responsibility. Also, there are inspiring moments when success occurs, especially when success is credited to all the team including family and society members.

6.18	 THE ‚ÄòDESIGN THINKING‚Äô ROLE IN AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY
Design thinking is a human-centred approach to innovation that draws from the designer‚Äôs toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success thus causing a triangle of inspiration. Design thinking enhances human process abilities thus helping to develop a mindset that will not follow conventional problem-solving ways. It is a type of thinking that relies on our ability to be intuitive, to recognize patterns, to construct ideas that are emotionally meaningful as well as functional, and to express ourselves through means beyond words or symbols. Design thinking thus provides inspiration through its establishment of an integrated holistic view that is based on feelings and intuitions.

The design thinking goes through three processes in the mindset:¬† inspiration, ideation and¬†implementation. Inspiration is the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions. Ideation is the process of generating, developing, and testing ideas. Implementation is the path that leads from the project stage into people‚Äôs lives.

6.19	 MEASURING INSPIRATIONAL LEARNING OF ORGANISATIONS
The concept of Organisational Learning (OL) has been of increasing importance to many researchers from different disciplines in the last two decades where a lot of research has been published with different variables that are thought to be a source of influence to OL (Ratnapalan and Uleryk, 2014). Many authors, at the same time, have been focusing on the importance of OL in changing the behaviours and practices of organisations, therefore enhancing its competitiveness (Jenkin, 2013; Malhotra, 1996). Once OL becomes part of the organisation norm, many organisations strive to improve their performance, detect and correct their errors and adapt to a new environment faster through using evolving knowledge (Nordin and Kasbon 2013).

Today, with an unstable knowledge-based society, socio-economic development is becoming part of most international indicators and measures, where OL is becoming part of a global innovation index (Economic Forum Report, 2014). Organisational: Competitiveness, Knowledge Management, Innovation, Entrepreneurship, Excellence have all been associated with OL‚Äôs existence and sustenance (Wahyuningsih, 2013; Buheji, 2010, 2011). Little work has been undertaken in really understanding what causes the ‚Äòspark‚Äù that leads to inspiration. The OECD (2012, 2010) reports on inspired learning have emphasised that one of the main constructs for such learning are practices as ‚Äúresearch‚Äù, ‚Äúinquiry based learning‚Äù, ‚Äúservice based learning‚Äù and ‚Äúcooperative learning‚Äù as sources of inspiration of the innovative learning environment for the 21st century.

6.20	 THE POWER OF FOCUSED THOUGHTS
Our thoughts seem to have a mind of their own and thus we feel on many times that we are in repetitive cycles of non-productive thinking. It is possible, however, to redirect our thoughts towards a positive focus. The uniqueness of our souls helps us to provide insights and joy, thus slowly disconnecting us from our sources that limit our beliefs. This means we overcome all the fear of learning that diverted us from our intended quest. Wayne Dyer says that ‚Äúwhen you are connected in that way, everyone around you is inspired through your spirit‚Äù. By being able to focus, Wayne advises that we can shift from ‚Äòwho we are‚Äô away from ‚Äòwhat we have‚Äô, ‚Äòwhat we do‚Äô, ‚Äòwhat is our reputation‚Äô, ‚Äòwhat people think of us‚Äô and all ego-based thinking. With the ability to focus we shift into ‚Äòthe understanding‚Äô that ‚Äòwho we are‚Äô is a piece of God. Since ‚Äòwho we are‚Äô is a piece of the source ‚Äì and when you stay connected to that in your thoughts you inspire others to do the same. It is really about modelling and letting people know you are an inspired person, a person who is has spirit. With focused powers we will see that this is what makes us admire certain people over others. There are certain characteristics that give certain people the ability to focus over others. One of these characteristics is our ability to stay with¬†what we love or attracts us. Inspiring others is not easy and the success rate in the beginning will be very low.¬†You will be out of focus with time if you try to inspire others by doing something you do not truly love doing. If, however, you love something dearly, you will keep your focus even if people start to doubt you, or stay calm when people laugh at your failures. Being focused means you will continue to do what you love because you love it.¬†So having depth, love and passion for something, will protect you from all potential failures.

Working with passion, keeps us focused while thinking big.¬†Just imagine how we can inspire if we keep this passion. Are there ways you can expand your impact? With passion you will not be looking to inspire few, but to inspire the whole world!¬†In order to share our ideas with as many people as possible we need to allow our persistence to grow our influence beyond initial ideas for inspiration. Thinking big is not only about inspiring more people, but also about the¬†impact you have on each person.¬†By being able to keep focused we can keep thinking about our positive impact. Another useful way to inspire others through focused thoughts is to support an established noble cause or practice, such as saving the environment or feeding the poor. By managing to build passion you gain a lot of influence just by publicly expressing that you are excited and passionate about a topic.¬†If you are not focused in your thoughts you make it much harder to inspire others.¬† You need to remain actively involved in the field in order to stay focused on what you intend to inspire others with. If you really want to inspire others to do something then this ‚Äòsomething‚Äô should be the focus of your life. You do not necessarily need to be an expert, but you do need to be passionately involved in this thing. The best part of being focused is that you will have to inspire others where you will instil intensity and extend inspiration. To keep focused there is a need to try to share with your followers personal stories and teach them things you have learned along the way. Also, when you talk about your failures and achievements, and ask them questions about their own progress, you really maintain a positive outlook on their forward progress which in turn will inspire you again for another initiative. People usually want to see and experience ideas, which are an opportunity for us to demonstrate our focus, and from this engender inspirational stories. The more we stay positive, work with past failures, and present optimism openly to others, the greater our ability to sustain inspiration.

6.21	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY AND PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE
Meaningful Learning is the process of relating new information to previous knowledge in a way that makes sense to the learner which leads to profound knowledge. This type of learning is unique since it provide a depth of processing that enables the learner to apply the newlyformed knowledge to new situations. Moving from hindsight to foresight creates a stability for the inspiration journey. This stability continuously needs the ‚Äúmoments of insight‚Äù which once developed can lead building a profound knowledge.

Many search for a profound knowledge from a variation knowledge, however this knowledge is based on the understanding of interaction between systems and people. Once people over this interaction requirement they would be able to learn faster and thus would have more probability to change and get inspired faster. Profound knowledge requires the ability to transform theories to methods and then to results. This leads to inspiration. This inspiration that comes within complex interdependent systems requires holistic thinking. This requires intrinsic motivation which can bring different strengths together to achieve ever better success story. In inspiration based economy where profound knowledge would be a source of differentiation, finding the proper medium of learning that best suits each learner would be very essential tool for inspiration. Facilitating for example value of ‚ÄòVisual Learning‚Äô would ensure higher probability of inspiration.

Reflective thinking is very important to the inspiration process. This type of thinking usually requires controlled doing plus involves pushing and pulling of concepts then putting them together and separating them again. Dr. Joseph Novak in the 1970s focused on the making and re-making of concept maps that are very important for reflective thinking that leads to profound knowledge. Novak and his colleagues seen that sharing concept maps based on reflective thinking with others would enhance our ability in learning how to learn. We consider this was the revolution that brought inspiration to be a main player for socio-economy. Inspiration found to be much related to those who practice ‚ÄòWebbing‚Äô. Webbing is a style of reading and thinking activity. Many inspiring writers, authors and even artists do webbing based on their repeated practice and training on how to create picture of relationships or develop a story or deal with newly-encountered concepts. This what made them a world class reference and unique in influencing people. With profound knowledge therefore we can create better inspiration economy environment that would transform ‚Äòreductionist thinking‚Äô to be more ‚Äòsystems thinking‚Äô. This means hierarchical based thinking would change towards process flow. Organisations would shift their focus from being driven by job specifications, targets and budgets, staff appraisals thinking towards more of interdependence, customer focused thinking. Once organisations or people establish their way in dealing with systems thinking the holistic system get established.

6.22	 ECOREMEDIATIONS AS A SOURCE FOR INSPIRATION ECONOMY
The concept of ecosystem technology, or what is called ecoremediation, means the usage of natural processes for restoration and protection of environment (eco + remediation = ‚Äúnatural renewed revival‚Äù). Using ecoremediation methods and practices found to decrease and abolish consequences of agricultural pollution, tourism, traffic, industry, dumping grounds and settlements. Ecoremediations mean returning to nature aiming to save and restore natural balance, where these kinds of areas give opportunity and is a source of inspiration to new working places and additional activities. Ecoremediations (ERM) have already been recognized as a continual approach, where natural and co-natural processes and systems are being used in favour of restoration of degraded environment and protection of natural environment. In practice ERM are used as constructed wetlands, co-natural sanitations of deposits, riverine vegetation zones ‚Äì balancing areas, side branches, artificial lakes, noise and/or dust reducing barriers, fitoremediations of polluted sediments, purifying soil and drinking water, tertiary purifying and purifying dangerous sewage water.

The inspiration of using ERM methods comes from the less money spent on sanitation of already threatened areas and thus ensuring the continual protection of such lands with high return on investment. ERM is an inspiration economy technique and a good example for Inspiration Labs¬© and also a good example of how the beyond abundance mindset leads to entirely new programs and outcomes. Using ecoremediations also opens more inspiration possibility through ability to ‚Äòinfluence without power‚Äô through saving energy and even gain it (usage of renewed energy sources). Such environmental friendly methods leads to more natural, functional and aesthetical point of view which have multipurpose effects, include simple, understandable and nature-friendly and acceptable procedures. Ecosystem is considered also an inspiration economy driver due to its ecological system where parts of animated and inanimate nature are connected in a functional unit (lah, 2002). The animated part connects plants, animals and human society which for their life need the inanimate part, air, water and soil. In such a connected system the substances circulate and the energy decants. Thus it is inspirational from the point of being self-sufficient where every part of the system impacts the others and every part depends on the functioning of the entire system. In history of human and nature symbiosis and due to lack of technical help, the human being was inspired by nature changes very carefully. Observation of nature led to lots of human learning. Retaining of water over the years was cleverly used as the drinking water source for watering of animals and plants. Self-cleaning capacities between plants and mayas had their own sewage system that led to the swamps, where it got cleaned. Natural ecosystems have in their ontogenesis developed many remediation systems that enable them to maintain a dynamic diversity and this creates an unique source of inspiration economy. At every intervention to the environment ecoremediations need to be compared, considered and implemented as an inspirational preventive measures for environment protection. Repairing damages done in environment is much more expensive and unreliable in comparison to preventing degradation. Therefore, we emphasize in inspiration based economy education understanding of nature activities, processes and monitoring (e.g. water purifying, retaining heavy metals in soil, noise mitigation). Great importance on informing, notifying and lifelong learning can come from the preventive meaning of ERM, because it includes different aim groups, i.e. from children to elderly, different profession profiles and different sectors (i.e. government and non-government institutions). ERM projects create societal or community inspiration since their preventive role lays countryside preservation and carry out common agricultural policy.

Slovenia is an inspirational story when it comes to being committed still to certain green economy practices and it has an exceptional advantage in Europe in the field of environment. Due to its specific industrial development in the past fortunately the environment is not polluted entirely (that was the case in many industrial developed countries). The inspiration economy of Slovenia thus remains its integral conatural development ability with maximal incorporation of local and regional potentials. Because of exceptionally favourable position the main wealth in Slovenia is in biotic diversity and water ecosystems that can be connected successfully with green economy. Ecosystematical approach is considered to be the base of ecoremediatios and is recognized as a suitable approach to manage natural sources and environment. Traditionally measures of managing were pointed at certain usage (agriculture, energetics, tourism) with defining regimes for every one of them. Ecosystematical managing means that flora, fauna and human society depend on each other and are connected with physical environment, which creates the ecosystem. Inspiration based economy should help to motivate such integral ecosystematical approach and enhance the concept of integration of water, river basin, river mouth, sea and coastal areas. The inspiration of ecosystem ‚Äì based management is that it is designed as the adaptable process that is based on learning with introducing scientific methods to processes of management (UNEP ‚Äì GPA, 2006). Table (6-1) adopted from (Sherman,1999) shows how ecosystematical managing carries inspiration economy practices.

Theory as well as practice have shown that local population can, under professional guidance, build many ERM themselves and can maintain them as too. at work their knowledge can be used, but also heavily employed workers can work, especially at maintenance. depending on sort of erm, as well some other products can be gained, for example energents (biomass, biodiesel, etheric oils, building material etc.) or tourist sightseeing can be offered for certain places that would enrich tourist offer. ERM is without a question important because of its long term efficiency, because environment protection and its renewal becomes the structural part of local population. with right upbringing it can be preserved for later regardless of education. In conclusion, every ecosystem has its own optimal conditions where it is in a kind of dynamic balance. Ecosystem has a lower and upper tolerance limit with every change as for natural as well as human impacts on upper or lower tolerance limit which can destroy ecological balance and ecosystem changes, or is degraded in another dynamic balance or ecosystem with different structure and function. Using ERM it is possible to mitigate the consequences that originate from the ecosystem and so to reduce the differences at tolerance limit of ecosystem as well as economical calculation of human impact.

One of the best practices visits we use to show the importance of Inspiration based economy is the educational polygon for self-sufficient supply in the settlement of Dole is based on the compliance with the principles of permaculture and ecovillage. The focus of the educational polygon is in identifying the possibilities of using natural resources for self-sufficiency in energy, which is closely related to mathematics, geography, geomorphology, climatic geography, hydro-geography, vegetation geography and soil geography. The inspiration of this polygon is that the whole principle is based on considering limited natural resources and rational spatial use. Ecoremediation, which is based on the laws of how nature operates, is used above all in protected areas (for protection) and in the areas where degradation is present (for sanitation). Ecoremediation establishes everyday practice for cleaning water, protecting soil, preventing the spreading of dust particles and erosion, accumulating sediments and improving life quality in general. the educational polygon for ecoremediation is based on innovative approaches, which enable participants to create their own experience and understanding on the basis of their own activity. Results show that ERM is a lasting method for environment protection because of its specific natural conditions (interweave of climate types, quick passages between natural units, biotic diversity and still preserved natural environment). Inspiration economy focus on doing more for environment, considering the government and citizen, to adjust the economical development to earth‚Äôs supporting capacities, as the eurobarometer in the report about the environment state in Europe establishes. Europe has all the capacities to take over the leading role at forming a more rational, competitive and safe model society.

Characteristics & Measures of an Inspiration Economy

7	 CHARACTERISTICS & MEASURES OF AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY
7.1	 INSPIRATION AS A MOTIVATOR
Inspiration involves motivation in which the individual strives to create an idea and would later try to do something new and creative with that idea. Inspiration is evoked without intentions, it requires interaction with people and the environment to stay alive and this in itself is a cause for being both focused and motivated. Although inspiration is unconscious, through recognizing situations or activities or the people that tend to inspire us, we are motivated to be more proactive and seek to create intentional stimulating experiences. Having psychological mastery, through inspiration, leads to more self-confidence, higher optimism and more potential motivation. However, it is worth mention that inspiration may not always lead to positive motivations, especially if positive energy is not properly utilised in realised actions. Steele (1977) believed that inspiration is often the motivator for questionable actions. Inspiration needs sources of ignition to happen. Even though we continuously repeat that failure, repetition and challenges create inspiration, we still can create inspiration through entertainment and fun, and thus create more motivation. Through inspiration, motivated people are often more willing to sacrifice to discover their potential. With the presence of inspiration we can create and/or overcome challenging decisions in life (Allen, et. al, 1998). This means that inspiration raises or motivates our ability to create an environment where people can thrive, grow, and live in peace with one another. Thus through inspiration harmony is promoted therefore sustaining future ability to create communities of shared responsibility. Inspiration depends on the type of stimulus, or object you are inspired from. We are inspired from people, models, examples, best practices, ideas, countries and most of all guru‚Äôs and game changers. Sometimes our countries, society, organisations, families can be a source of our inspiration. Once inspired, we are motivated to transmit and actualize a certain realization. Thrash and Elliot (2004) see inspiration as a process of either being ‚Äòinspired by‚Äô and ‚Äòinspired to‚Äô which lead to motivation. Many people do not differentiate between inspiration and motivation even though there is a big difference. Self-improvement can happen through motivation such as rewards, suffering, fear or a constant ‚Äúpumping yourself up‚Äù. Motivation¬† is like getting advice from someone about how to live your life. While inspiration comes with the drive to discover and find the sense of life‚Äôs purpose trapped within you.¬†Inspiration requires the time to find the inner voice within oneself that can truly inspire you without the need for extrinsic motivators.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Characteristics & Measures of an Inspiration Economy

Wayne Dyer says ‚Äúmotivation means we have an idea and we are going to carry through on that idea. We work hard at it, and we are disciplined. A highly motivated person takes an idea, goes out there, and won‚Äôt let anybody interfere with them‚Äù. Inspiration is exactly the opposite. If motivation is when you have an idea and carry it through to its conclusion,¬†inspiration¬†is the reverse. An idea gets hold of you and carries you where you intend to go. The word inspired comes from being in spirit, accessing a force out there. When you are inspired by some great purpose, your mind transcends limitations and your consciousness expands in every direction, and you find yourself in a new wonderful world. Many things that you thought were inaccessible and may be unavailable come alive when you are inspired. You discover yourself to be a far greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be.

7.2	 CHARACTERISTICS OF INSPIRED PEOPLE
The reviewed literature shows that inspired individuals‚Äô value the essence and value of things, as they consistently see the big picture. Inspired individuals usually try to maintain or even discover the awakening of what makes them unique or more innovative. Inspired people are found to believe that inspiration is not just about creating a wholly unique idea, but may be about incorporating old valuable ideas into something unique. The inspired see exposure to a stimulating experience or playing with an idea leads to a learning opportunity that can help people progress toward excellence. Inspiration has a positive impact upon their well-being and life satisfaction, it is something like a self-empowerment. Research on the characteristics of the inspired shows that our ability to inspire others depends on the level of influence we can reach; i.e. our ability to develop a vision that is both clear and highly appealing for us and/or to others (Zarda, 2012). It is found that inspired people show confidence and optimism by self-recognizing their small accomplishments towards their goals. Also it is found that such people do their best to achieve key organizational or society values (Hart, 1998). Hart (2000) latter came to believe that inspired people have the characteristics of honesty, integrity, self-motivation, self-confidence, cognitive ability, intelligence, knowledge of the business, emotional intelligence and flexibility, which are the same characteristics and/ or traits seen in this study. An inspired person differs usually from others by their ability to discover. Inspiration thus builds in people the willingness to give focused effort to produce unique innovative work (Catmull and Wallace, 2014). Our ability to inspire others depends on the level of influence we can reach; i.e. our ability to develop a vision that is both clear and appealing to followers. The more we can bring a clear vision for life and promote it the more we can inspire. Inspired people show confidence and optimism by recognizing small accomplishments towards their goals. They have dramatic actions to symbolize key organizational values. William Arthur Ward said ‚ÄúThe pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails‚Äù. When you review inspirational moments of legendary people you will find these happened during: moments of failure or segregation from others; including being segregated in jail! Sometimes a wave of inspiration will happen during a visit (i.e. museums, or listening to art). Inspiration might happen during friends‚Äô discussions, community volunteering programmes and charity giving activities, or when we are involved in certain projects. Many who have left a legacy have mentioned that visiting a library or other civic place has lead to a build up of inspiration. However, most inspirational legends have really been inspired by other inspiring role models.

We know people who through moments of quiet gardening, watching the waves of the sea, listening to music or even painting move their inspiration. Other inspirational models link their inspirational moments to spiritual activities such as brainstorming or dialoguing about the ‚Äúbigger picture‚Äù. Also, you will have heard friends talk about their experience of inspiration that happened during walking or even attending lectures or conferences. Thrash and Elliot (2004) compared individuals who wrote about inspiration as an event characterized as transcendence. In this event the inspired experiences elevated levels of spirituality and meaning, derived from self-reporting measures. They also used more words that reflect insight, such as ‚Äúrealized‚Äù. Having such measures and focus government and major companies will move economies to more stable intrinsic based levels. The Thrash team observed that people sometimes confuse ‚Äòpositive affective‚Äô states with inspiration. Transcendence did not only entail spirituality and meaning but also illumination, openness, and state introversion. Research about inspiration characteristics has yet to confirm the brain regions and neurophysiological processes that underpin inspiration. Nevertheless, the regions that underpin related states, such as insight, have been explored.

7.3	 INSPIRATION AS A SOURCE OF LEGACY
The research carried out in the area of inspiration shows that inspiration can be undertaken as a source of legacy, besides being a source of motivation and an economic driver. Throughout history, people who knew they were being inspired, had a clear sense of self-satisfaction and direction about their legacy when they talked about it. Literature shows that inspiration is about discovering what you most love and spend time doing. You know you are inspired when you enjoy success and/or the good feelings that this creates which brings you more towards your legacy (Andrews and Withey, 1976). Brown and Pabon (2014) indicated that people feel more inspired when they have the ability to learn through seeing with their eyes and heart and not only their eyes. This is the level of inspiration that leads to a legacy. The knowledge of being inspired toward creating a legacy can affect positively our socioeconomies and thus creates a sensitive feeling and high consciousness, as observed by Harts (1998 and 2000). This inspiration status is recognized within us when we reach self-actualization, self-esteem and high belongingness (Lockwood and Kunda, 1999). We start our legacy based inspiration when we see the positive impact on our psychological well-being and thus the wellbeing of others in different ways, i.e. business or social wellbeing.

When we are inspired towards a legacy we will proactively seek and encourage inspirational experiences for personal, organizational and society purposes. Exposure to stimulating experiences such as networking, observing recent trends around us, involving decision-making and solving problems, and being around high-spirited persons, represents inspirational opportunities that enhance our learning and ability to innovate. These inspirational experiences can motivate people and help our societies integrate newly generated ideas into actions thus producing desired outcomes while enhancing our communities‚Äô readiness towards change. Legacy based inspiration can come from new and striking combinations of ideas. You might be a literature and poetry passionate and at the same time a physician. James Watt‚Äôs legacy rested not only in his passion as an engineer for steam engines, but also in the combination of wisdom, poetry and archaeology. Einstein‚Äôs legacy was not only as a physicist but a source of inspiration for many scientists, thinkers, mathematicians and philosophers. Many others who came before them or after them know their legacy was inspired through the hybrid collection of ideas that built their holistic view which shaped our world today and moved humanity to another level of socio-economy and development.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Characteristics & Measures of an Inspiration Economy

A legacy that stays and moves the economy depends on the passion that amalgamates with the sufficient knowledge of the subject and a variety of extraneous knowledge to produce new and original combinations of ideas. Technical skill can be used towards a legacy and is developed through the flow of ideas. Dreams of a legacy can be achieved by persistence to create the difference this can be seen since the time of Greek philosophers such as Aristotle to scholars such as Ibn Sina and later Jack Christopher. They all achieved their contributions in different areas of knowledge, with sustainable inspiration until today because of holistic integrated knowledge. Inspiration triggers a variety of interests that tend to increase the richness of ideas associated with new and original combinations of thought. The old-fashioned idea to establish a solid foundation of knowledge has lead to a durable legacy. Inspiration establishes a legacy that requires laying work aside to mature while making a reflection on its achievements. Inspiration needs to be practiced for some time with the mind able to return with a fresh outlook. Through working towards inspiration that leads to legacy, we are always under pressure to bring ideas into fruition.

7.4	 INSPIRATION AS A PROCESS
Wallas (1926) was one of the earliest who suggested that inspiration is a creative process that consists of four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Inspiration is dominated by the conscious during preparation and verification, whereas unconscious, unwilled processes are responsible for incubation and for producing illumination. Later, Kris (1952) explained that creative inspiration causes the individual to be involved in flexible thinking, thus making novel associations more likely. From the Inspirational Economy point of view the more we manage to enhance the speed and the quality of this process the more we manage to make our socio-economies more independent and self-renewable. Opportunities once captured, a promising idea emerges. Inspiration then evolves as a process which generates a novel idea (Ward et. al., 1995). Certain researchers found that the process of merging unrelated images may yield pre-inventive forms of inspiration that are extended to a new invention (Finke, 1995). Inspiration as a process tends to be associated with the ability to visualize with just the generation of ideas. It is noted that inspiration as a process is accepted in almost all cultures and since the beginning of humanity. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato suggested that poets can inspire their readers through their words‚Äô influence at any time (Rothenberg & Hausman, 1976). The process of having two ideas integrated together creates new abilities for people to envision and study the implications (Ward, 2001).

The inspiration process is beyond the normal process of living. We can make a living from the processes we create, while we can make a legacy from the processes we give. The emergence of creative ideas in consciousness occurs as an inspiration process only when we are willing to give. Often we give during a moment of insight, or under optimal conditions, or with our capacity for creating change. In all these cases there is both a process of (being inspired by) followed by a process of (being inspired to), which provide continuity of action. Once the process leads to creative inspiration it often leads to transmission and actualization (Thrash, et. al., 2010).

7.5	 SYNERGETIC PRACTICES AND THE INSPIRATION PROCESS
Inspiration as a process occurs when there is intrinsic quality or extrinsic quality. For extrinsic quality brainstorming can help ideas to be built on even trivial or silly things with no worries about criticism or judgment. Participants in the brainstorming session try to have as many ideas as possible in a specific time. The objective is to solve problems and enjoy doing it. With collective brainstorming we can identify issues rapidly to reach a source of inspiration through consensus on the most important issues rapidly, while determining possible solutions to chronic issues. Brainstorming leads to synergistic decision making based on the premise that when people are supportive of one another and follow a rational sequence of activities in dealing with a problem, they can perform beyond the sum of their individual resources. Synergistic decision making requires participation in effective interpersonal and rational processes. Interpersonal processes are another form of synergetic practices that involve listening to each other, team work, supporting positive efforts, and managing diversity and thus lead to lighting an inspiration candle. Through interpersonal processes we are inspired to participate equally in group discussions thus creating more synergic opportunities. Synergetic practices lead to rational processes that involve the way of thinking and handling a problem all the way until a solution. During this process inspiration has a greater possibility to be raised. Also, through analysing the situation and identifying objectives one can consider more clearly the alternative strategies that lead to better motivation and sustainability of the journey. The inspiration process can be built around the efforts of trying to reach a consensus. For example, when trying to achieve ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù that leads to an effective decision equation: quality X acceptance, keeps us in search of the best outcome.

7.6	 BETWEEN EXPERIENCE AND INSPIRATION
Experience for a long time has been both a source of slow inspiration and a restrictor of human development. With experience we grow, but we do not actually develop. With total dependence on our experience we keep our abilities contained in the past not in the future. Only when we stop looking backwards, can we look forward, or be able to give time to absorb the moment, or even to forecast what is coming clearly and accurately. The level of human intelligence is much beyond estimation and forecasting. Intelligence is about the ability to foresee the future. This means that we as humans have similar intrinsic intelligence opportunities that depend on our abilities to see something from within or outside our contained boxes. The more we let go of our claimed experience, the more we can overcome our paradigm obstacles and thus open the blind spots surrounding our visionary insight. Once you overcome the ego and the accumulated attachment to the past, inspiration will occur. Once inspiration occurs you are eager to go back to experience and seek solutions and look forward for new solutions that we call discovery, i.e. pushing you to try or test things never tried before.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Characteristics & Measures of an Inspiration Economy

Robert Kiyosaki mentioned in his book ‚ÄúRich Dad Poor Dad‚Äù how he and his friend when they were 9 years old were inspired by the feeling of their superior school colleagues who came from richer families. Kiyosaki mentioned that this hurt was good, because it inspired him and his other poor friend to keep thinking of a way to make money. High self-esteem and good self-confidence are essential traits to help build inspiration that depends on trying and is away from experience and co-dependence. This confidence would not stay without practice. The history of inspiring leaders including Gandhi shows that all of these leaders in the beginning had to ‚Äúfake it until they made it‚Äù; i.e. through gradual practice of being confident, it became a reality and a part of their attitudes and hence confidence became part of who they are. Therefore, if you have a problem with how other people see you, becoming a source of inspiration requires that you first deal with your difficulties by accepting more and more challenges. However, one has to remember that whatever we do; we will not manage to suite all people‚Äôs satisfaction. This is why inspiring people always see the big picture more than trying to suite other people‚Äôs wishes or tastes. With time people change because of their persistence. Inspiration requires building up the ability to keep getting up after experiences of failure. There will be plenty of failures as you try to discover what inspires you. Inspired people are unique because they are more prepared to make decisions that will not always succeed. Because they know that if risks are not taken, then the potential for success will not be realized. This is why they are different and this is why they achieve more.

7.7	 HUMBLENESS WITH OBJECTIVITY AS SECRETS OF INSPIRATION
We are humble when we are inspired in a way that we learn that our best abilities are hidden with us. The objectivity that leads to the moment of truth leads us to see with our eyes the heart and minds of others or inspiring sources make us unique in our ability to deal with opportunities. Humbleness on the other hand creates the time we need to control inquiry and feed curiosity. Therefore, when both the act of objectivity meets the practice of humbleness we can really value self-esteem (Robins et. al., 2001). Exploring operational integrity with availability of both humbleness and eagerness for high objectivity enhances the quality of the products and services delivered. When society is inspired it will see and resent any oppressiveness and try to have social balance in the distribution of power. Inspired society is an advocate of radical change, and this will be the trend of the next economy.

Great moments of inspiration come after structured or unstructured humility that make us face the moment of truth more clearly with a well controlled ego. Life teaches us that after many years of maturity we can see the moment of truth more easily, but we might miss the spirit of youth that helps us to move faster and be leaner. Studying the wisdom of humbleness in the holy scripts of the major religions in the world tells us that the moment of truth comes when we realise the essence of humility by seeing the depth of what we read or believe. Reading and reflecting on the best inspiring leaders and gurus that have affected our life will also tell us that we need to be prepared to cope with humiliation to realize self-potential, as this will open up learning or unlearning opportunities. The more this learning and unlearning happens as part of a society‚Äôs norm it will differentiate the economy towards being agile and competitive. You will find among anecdotes that a success story begins after people start to recover from humiliation and absorb lessons from it. Consistent practice of humility and/or the seeds of humbleness to one‚Äôs self, while undertaking self-evaluation, is found to help stretch our spirit, and is not discouraged by growing pains. Getting used to humility (by choice) makes you realize how to deal with situations when people stand in your way.¬†Therefore, the exercise of humility helps us to develop what we call a ‚Äúthick skin‚Äù and a heart of great compassion towards unleashing the truth that we search for. Only when you study the life of those who have created a major change in our times and how they reached their legacy will you appreciate the importance of patience on the experience of humility experience that you need to do with your brain. This exercise will make you value your next role and assignment, if it proves to be of value to the world as a whole. Besides working on creating a humble self, inspiration requires objectivity. You will rarely see that an inspired person or society think just producing more without a planned effect. Actually, part of the goals of inspiration that you can see are more clearly the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen‚Äù to start a journey. This is called ‚Äúpull thinking‚Äù. Yes, inspiration about this ‚Äúpull thinking‚Äù that is very selective and that differentiates itself from ‚Äúpush thinking‚Äù which targets to fulfil needs based on bulk and quantity. One cannot reach legacy based inspiration if the search starts with ego or bias. The more we follow an objectively based scientifically evidenced search for truth, the more we hit a real inspiration milestone and control our ego. Objectivity is not easily achieved, but practicing objectively based methodologies is possible. Keeping the freedom of questioning anything with what, why and how surely enhance our ability to be more objective in search of what might be an inspiration for us or our community.

Economic analysis is based on the idea that individuals respond systematically to changes in relative prices. The incentives set from outside motivate people to act in a predictable way. In order to make people discover the unknown within themselves we need to help them towards unpredictable motivation, i.e. through understanding their intrinsic capacities, capabilities, competencies and changeability; which we call the 4 C‚Äôs of power within. Market outcomes and stability are found to be affected by the level of society‚Äôs openness to self-search and re-orientation with blind spots of current practices. Even though inspiration is sometimes affected by extrinsic motivation, mostly self-initiative is what makes the competitive advantage difference in the life journey. While having the capacity of self-search would lead to more focused persistent initiatives that overcome all the types of obstacles ahead. Self-driven inspiration is a behaviour that influences many areas of economic, social and political life. The integration of self-driven inspiration with the socio-economy produces practices that increase the possibility of transformation towards an inspiration economy. The availability of work ethics as voluntary compliance, self-monitoring and transparency leads to a higher probability of inspiration.

People under intentional focused interventions build a sense of self-determination which affects how they perceive their role in life. With focused interventions a feeling of justice is built in a community (Deci and Ryan, 1985). One of the challenges of self-initiated inspiration is the hidden costs of reward, where people already have a high interest in an activities results while they are getting less intrinsic inspiration in the long run (Frey und Osterloh, 2001; Freyund Jegen, 2001). Therefore, many psychologists believe that changing external instruments for inspiration help to explain monetary rewards, and regulating the use of punishment but proves to have little or sometimes even counterproductive effects. Identity and ego can lead to decisions that stand in conflict with rational self-search. A strong identity can undermine the workings of economic incentives if people behave according to their ego (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000).

7.8	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY GLOBAL INDEX
Inspiration is based on the relationship and measurement of relationships. A robust economy is built around the ability to balance or manipulate relationships to help develop a middle class majority. Inspiration causes a different type of income, but above all makes people become happier and to feel that they can contribute and create a change. Using a data set of 126 countries from different competitiveness indicator reports there is a clear correlation between happiness, life satisfaction and countries‚Äô inspirational achievements. The clearest determinant of inspiration seems to be the individuals‚Äô and society‚Äôs wellbeing, at least in the outcome of inspiration. Inspiration indicators cannot be involved with government spending; however, they are clearly linked to a striving towards better wellbeing. Using indicators that measure inspirational economic practices in public policy have shown to have an effect on determining the moral values and the level of freedom of the economy. Social capital (for example: low divorce rates, high rates of membership in voluntary organizations, high levels of trust within society) is a unique bundle of socio-economic factor that differentiates one type of inspiration based economy from the other. Indicators that are focused on the level of availability, frequency and intensity of inspiration will be other important measures for a country or society‚Äôs performance.

7.9	 THE INSPIRATION ECONOMY GLOBAL INDEX (IEGI)
One of the inspiring speeches by David Cameron, the UK‚Äôs current prime minister, in 2010 focused on the need for inspiration for a better competitive UK. Cameron suggested: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs time to admit that there‚Äôs more to life than money, and it‚Äôs time we focus not just on GDP, but on GWB ‚Äògeneral well-being‚Äô. Recently, David Cameron again stated ‚Äò[measures of wellbeing] could give us a general picture of whether life is improving‚Äô and eventually ‚Äòlead to government policy that is more focused not just on the bottom line, but on all those things that make life worthwhile‚Äô. So, well-being can be an indicator or it can be an index with a collection of indicators. As inspiration, as well as wellbeing, cannot be measured by money or the amount it is used for trade in the market, we need to measure these through different constructs. The collection of the Inspiration Economy Global Index (IEGI) should focus on how the indicators would measure what are the achievements of governments and societies that are working on the delivery of inspiration that lead to wellbeing. The new inspiration based economy will depend on indicators that focus on positive interference that enhance the possibility of inspiration and help to establish a consistent new approach that involves education, innovation, entrepreneurship and competitions that shape the future economy. An IEGI is needed more than ever today since with this global index the concerned world will see how inspiration might be empowered or improved towards the betterment of humanity.

7.10	 THE LITERACY OF INSPIRATION
Inspiration comes from something deep inside the human spirit, mind and heart. It is more of sense of need to achieve a desire, a dream, a vision that. Those inspired would exert differentiation be going the extra step and with the ability to enhance the capacity versus the demand. Therefore you‚Äôll find them producing last-minute stamina, with unique will to achieve not only do. This needs an educational system that address this well creation. Education and empowerment goes hand in hand if we want a world that is more caring, tolerant, innovative, inspiring and peaceful. Inspiration literacy requires much more than learning and empowerment, it requires self-discovery. This discovery might be more ignited by the help of other surrounding factors such as families, communities and socio-economies, or even the politics of the country. We believe that countries in the future will surely gauge this measure, i.e. it does not matter how many citizens can manage to read and write, or even know how to deal with technology, but it will be equally important how many of these actually have inspiration literacy; i.e. able to generate and deal with inspiration.

There are many promising approaches to developing inspiration literacy as we can see from best practices that today‚Äôs internet and social media bring to us, from around the world. In this handbook we cover all these best practices even though we are living in a very dynamic and changing environment. Today, and even more in the future with a click of a button you can reach many good video and case studies that show how a project or community is creating a new wave of inspiration to its targeted audience. However, the world is still in need of how to bundle the essence of what and why these stories are being a source of inspiration In this handbook we try to synthesis how all this inspiration creates a series of related waves that affect our lifestyle and the way we deal with life. The early wave of inspiration demonstrates the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô and ‚Äòhow‚Äô, the second wave raises the imagination, while the third wave structures the determination within oneself. Once this series of inspiration waves takes affect, inspiration literacy starts to be established in one‚Äôs life. The inspired individual or group starts to place enquiries and utilise this learning towards making a difference. In a world which is still missing such programmes; the creation of waves and also measuring the wave‚Äôs impact are expected to be a major phenomena.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Characteristics & Measures of an Inspiration Economy

One of the most interesting inspirational films ever seen and read as a book is ‚ÄúGifted Hand‚Äù. The film refers back to 1961, when Ben Carson was an 11-year-old African American and had been a failing school student. His single mother, who had just finished the third grade, was distressed about her sons‚Äô academic failures and decided to do something about it. First she required Ben and his older brother, Curtis, to learn the multiplication tables while she was away for treatment, but she realized that her sons were watching too much TV. Ben‚Äôs mother decided to restrict her sons to see only 2 shows a week and required them to read two books a week and write book reports, without telling them that she did not know how to read the reports. Even though, Ben‚Äôs mother, as can be seen in the story of the film, illiterated that she was better than many highly educated people in her time and today who do not have inspirational literacy. The ‚ÄúGifted Hand‚Äù book shows that based on the mother‚Äôs commitment Ben and Curtis soon began their first inspiration where they started to love reading and learn many things from the world of books, so that within one year Ben went from the bottom of his class to the top. After hard work and strong determination, Ben received a scholarship to Yale, where he met his wife, Candy, who supported him in his struggles to get through Yale. After studying neurosurgery, he was finally accepted as a resident at John Hopkins Hospital. Ben today is considered one of the most popular surgeons in the world. You will find in many developed and developing countries that there are many programmes available that are celebrated at both national and international levels, but their real impact is limited compared to the inspirational literacy that Ben‚Äôs mother created in his life. We are talking about a major difference even in achievement, to the extent that if you ask many people even in developed countries ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs your purpose in life‚Äô, it is normal to receive an answer ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô. There are other cases of inspirational illiteracy in different situations and different settings. You will find, for example, in Africa that there are not enough programmes, or time for small or scattered programmes that develop the best athletes, runners or sprinters, with little or limited resources, yet international achievements are high. This is due to inspirational illiteracy for self-development by the people themselves. In these countries mainly due to local initiatives and inspired belief, learning comes from the need for survival that pushes the voluntary spirit to maximum capacity, to something even beyond describable determination. Inspiration Economy literacy is about the will to change and how to change. Transformation can happen in many countries and societies not through the normal programmes of empowerment, but through focusing on inspiration literacy and motivating efforts that help to overcome the vulnerability of the weak amongst us through exposing the powers within. This leads to the development of greater self-driven equality that carries the spirit that ‚ÄòI can‚Äô.

With socio-economic disparities, increasing and global crises over food, water and energy, inspiration literacy is not a luxury; in fact it is a survival technique to continue in a fiercely competitive world. If inspiration literacy spreads throughout many areas and professions on a continent it leads to a lot of self-empowerment where people do not wait for help or opportunities to come and capture them, instead they create them. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) reports that once mothers are inspired by education, they recognise the importance of healthcare and have a greater influence on their children‚Äôs educational attainment than their fathers. Women who have completed primary education are likely to have fewer children as well as fewer unintended births. They add that educated women have more control over household negotiations, and are more likely to be economically active and contribute to the costs of schooling (UNFPA, 2013). Inspiration based literacy be it through education, creativity activities, family welfare programmes; can lead to a better life outcome and even in many instances to a legacy. Re-visiting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) we believe that inspiration can play a role in bringing together collective forces to achieve them faster and in less resource based ways. All issues affected by the need of empowerment should be re-visited, if the world starts to believe about the importance of ‚Äòinspiration literacy‚Äô it is a key to many closed doors in life.

7.11	 CONCEPT AND IDEAS GENERATION
Inspiration happens when Ideas which initially appear infeasible can often be improved, ‚Äúdebugged‚Äù or ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù by other members of the team. Inspiration by concept generation comes when scientists, researchers, team members, project managers, organisation leaders and change mentors use graphical and physical illustrations or media to express an idea. For concepts to be generated and create inspiration they need to go through the process of observations and reasoning with control of non-scientific or evidence based judgments. Concept generation leads to inspiration if ideas are captured at the right time. Concept generation requires a clear intention with willingness to test and implement ideas. If ideas are worked upon immediately, the source of the idea absorbs its importance. Working up imagination to impact an idea, the idea can be turned into a concept and a recipe for creativity. Generating the concept of a different flow of ideas is an important part of inspiration. The more ideas are generated by an individual or a team, the more likely one is to explore ‚Äòsolution space‚Äô. However, most inspiration based ideas happen today due to the presence of extrinsic rather than intrinsic stimulus. Occasional random stimuli can also be an effective source of the concept of inspiration.

Analogical thinking is found to be another strong source of concept development that leads to inspiration and the development of the generation of new concepts. This type of practice motivates analogical thinking within our powers and thus leads to more opportunity for a new inspiration and contribution to the human journey. Concept generation is based on organised thoughts, since it is not straight forward. Therefore, sometimes it is important to scan the business environment or customer needs and target specific goals to create the inspiration considered. As per figure (7-1) concept generation can lead to inspiration and consist of five main steps: clarification of the problem, scanning for environment (external and internal), systematic exploration and final reflection on the solutions and process.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Characteristics & Measures of an Inspiration Economy

Gravey (2013) gives a perspective on how the economy is linked to the discovery of our ‚Äòpurpose of life‚Äô and how having a happy life might create a socio economic influence. Therefore it is thought that discovering how to achieve financial desires is one of the main indicators of an inspiration economy. Inspiration economy indicators focus on measuring first how we manage life challenges. Indicators also measure one‚Äôs ability to deal with opportunities thus being able to discover the hidden potential within the self. Inspiration Economy indicators usually measure how the group of individuals, a community, or society have managed to develop positive thinking and practices that help people to discover their power. The indicators reduce our non-productive thinking and ability to redirect thoughts towards a positive focus that lead to being a source of an inspiration economy. Since an inspiration economy focuses on transforming scarcity into sustained abundance, one of the main indicators will be around this issue. This type of pull thinking once started for it to be measured it will help to speed up the shift of maintaining healthiness and natural wealth. Pull thinking helps us to discover how to release patterns that control our productivity and make us more focused on a future direction and outcomes not results. Measuring indicators need to show how inspiration is a result of activities that move individuals to focused productive situations due to being, for example, part of a team, being trained by a specific coach and/or counselled by wise mentors, or due to the focused reading of books or stories. Sometimes a challenging environment, or trying to overcome difficult situations, is the main characteristic of an inspiring environment and again this needs to be measured directly or indirectly. South Korea, for example, has one of the fastest developing and inspiring societies today. By having indicators that measure the type of well disciplined, honest, fair, responsible, accountable, punctual, approachable and most important nationalistic contributions, we are really measuring South Korean inspiration as a culture. Another indicator of an inspiration based economy is having an effective leadership style where leaders see that inspiration practices and programmes are part of the focused transformation programmes (Hart, 1993). Since the work of both Thrash and Elliot (2003) suggests that inspiration, if delivered in various forms with different background participants, can give different meanings, we need to establish measurements around this issue too. Indicators should measure whether this inspiration leads to a variety of inspirations that can reach the heights of human motivation and awaken us to better possibilities, and this can be another source of indication.

Inspiration might create a butterfly effect through the combination of new and old ideas that lead to broader thinking. Indicators on this measure the possibility of having holistic thinking that utilises a physician, engineer, or a lawyer to experience and enhance it to develop further the studies of the history of science. Most inspired figures in our recent or old history are not made by wish, but by hard focused work and sacrifice and therefore this should be another form of indicator that can be used to measure the realisation of such practices. The inspired person does not decide exactly on the process of achievement, but rather focuses on the process of perfecting the delivery time after time thus making it more value added.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Characteristics & Measures of an Inspiration Economy

Many Muslim scholars such as Ibn Sina, Al-Razi, Ibn-Rushd, Ibn-Alnafees and Ibn-Alhaitham managed to have rich contributions in different areas of knowledge due to the holistic integrated knowledge mindset, and this therefore can be another important indicator for measuring an inspiration economy, i.e. having a holistic mindset. For example, some leading scholars, practitioners and artists in our world today have managed to bring many ideas outside the norm of a subject and have become associated with inspiration, due to their ability to create the integration of these ideas with what makes the difference to the world, or at least to their specialty. This type of practice is today called disruptive innovation as per Christensen et. al. (2010) and also needs to be measured as part of the potential presence of inspiration. In the 13th century, the word ‚Äúvalue‚Äù, was generally associated with money, and comes from the Latin (valorum), which means ‚Äòto be worthy or strong.‚Äô While the word competition, which comes from the Latin (competere) means ‚Äòto strive together.‚Äô Therefore, Anielski (2015) and other researchers see that future economies of well-being will be based on genuine competition, reciprocity and shared responsibility. Robert Kennedy in 1968 said that the Gross National Product (GNP), the key measure of economic progress, had failed to measure the things that actually make life worthwhile. And Simon K√ºznets, one of the key architects of the national income accounting system, noted that ‚Äúnational income concepts will have to be either modified or partly abandoned, in favour of more inclusive measures, less dependent on the appraisals of the market system‚Äù. Joseph Stiglitz stated clearly that ‚ÄúGDP has failed to capture the factors that make a difference in people‚Äôs lives and contribute to their happiness (security, leisure, income distribution and a clean environment.‚Äù The Dalai Lama repeatedly said that ‚Äòwe need an economic system that enables the pursuit of true happiness.‚Äô There are only few countries that are really trying to make a breakthrough with indicator measurements such as Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Bhutan. In fact Bhutan is already pioneering a new well-being accounting system with their Gross National Happiness (GNH) framework. We believe that our world needs more political leaders like Bhutan‚Äôs Prime Minister Jigme Yoser Thinley who believes that ‚ÄúIn Bhutan, personal spiritual fulfilment is not just a spiritual pursuit, it is government policy. The government‚Äôs role is to help create conditions that will help Bhutan people find happiness‚Äù. This radical shift in seeing things is what has made Bhutan and Costa Rica one of the developed and leading countries when it comes to their citizens‚Äô quality of life.

7.14	 CAPTURING MOMENTS OF INSPIRATION
Sometimes we will lose inspiring moments in life due to our inability to capture them at the right moment (of time and space). Most of the time, we lose these precious moments just because we are not able to take a pause and reflect on that moment in relevance to circumstances.

Through inspiration we have moments of clarity. It is these moments which reflect how we consciously or unconsciously get there. It is not clear when exactly we have these moments, or why we have them. You might have an idea, for example, while you are in total meditation, or while you are playing football with your friends, or before sleep, or in the shower. These ideas might have been neglected for a long time and something tells you or influences you to do it today. Sometimes there may be simply no rhyme or reason for it. The difference between those that capture these moments and those it would pass by is the same difference between life and death. Capturing the aha moment or the moment of inspiration, means we need to train ourselves to let go from forcing it to be both active and productive, since this controlled command increase the chances of not being able to capture the blind spots or in other words lessen our opportunities to be creative. Inspirational moments come after preparation and rumination. Therefore, every time you take a pause, you can reflect on what in your mind is seeking to complement with your spirit. Given that a positive affect is involved in both the insight ‚Äúaha‚Äù experience and inspiration, the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment may facilitate a fluid transition from insight to inspiration. Inspirational moments are not easy to handle most of the time, but once they are part of your life, with more practice and certain techniques, you cannot live without them. Our brain can only come up with so many ideas by itself every second. However, the practice of some people being able to bounce idea(s) with themselves or others makes them more open minded people. Even when brainstorming idea(s) with young children, it creates¬† a source of waves and opportunities of inspirational moments that help to funnel ideas. The exercise might lead to ideas that can be integrated with other ideas to help to further reduce the area of fuzziness until the inspiration occurs. The more you make your brain dynamic, the more capable one will be to capture opportunities that come with inspirational moments.

7.15	 INSPIRATION FORMS, FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY
Inspiration comes in different forms, frequency and intensity. This dynamic scale helps different economies and societies through choices of variety. For example, inspiration frequency was found to predict the number of patents held and also predicts creativity at a person level. Inspiration and self-reported creativity is also found to fluctuate across days (Thrash and Elliot,¬†2003). This is healthy for the sustainability of an economy that is driven by people who have different preferences and visions of life.

Inspiration if delivered in various forms can reach the lay public, as ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù shades have different meaning depending on people‚Äôs role and capacity of realising their role in life. Therefore, conceptions of inspiration are important for future research. Hart (1993) observed that despite the many shades of ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù meaning and its common usage, appears to represent a clear and consistent event. Previous research, relying on lay conceptions of inspiration, has yielded findings that are consistent. Inspiration with its rainbow of colours is seen as a flux of different possibilities of a human renewable spirit with a willingness to give or sacrifice for the cause visualised and seen, even with high intensity and frequency (Dubai, 1999). Inspiration thus falls more within positive psychology, and also management of change, beside self-development, which are all highly needed subjects. Inspired individuals, as shown in the forms of inspiration discussed in literature, differ from others in their ability to discover. This ability was differentiated since inspired individuals managed to integrate a special mix of an inspirational form with certain frequency and intensity of thoughts. This is why such inspiration plays an important role for both personal and professional growth and development though it tends to be an overlooked concept.

In research designed to explore people‚Äôs experiences with inspiration the Buheji et. al. (2014) team investigated why inspiration matters. Research findings revealed that people‚Äôs experience with inspiration is a worthy part of their lives, it is evoked by repeated challenging situations, and it helps them meet their personal and business related needs. Inspiration was found to have a role in changing, or enhancing individual characteristics and traits such as being more persistent, prudent and accountable which can encourage further research in this area. In today‚Äôs competitive environment, we tend to focus on measuring competencies, abilities, skills and knowledge; however we fail to recognize the importance of inspiration‚Äôs role. There are yet few research papers that try to answer the importance of inspiration. One reason why inspiration tends to be overlooked is its fluid and intangible nature, that is not easily quantified or traced, therefore studies in these areas are critical for the development of an inspiration based economy.

7.16	 ANATOMY OF INSPIRATION
‚ÄòSomething that can‚Äôt be measured can‚Äôt be improved‚Äô. A slogan we repeatedly say without realising that there are many things in life that are not measured. Measurement of anything requires understanding its anatomy. The anatomy of inspiration has not been well studied from the point of view of expectations, experiences, needs, and interaction patterns nor studied from the point of view of organization and the cultural environment (Thrash and Elliot, 2004). A better understanding of the biological basis of inspiration will illuminate the process through which creative ideas ‚Äúfire the soul‚Äù. For example, we are clear why inspired individuals are compelled to transform ideas into products and solutions that may benefit society and the world, when others are not (Thrash et. al., 2010). As discussed earlier, inspiration is seen as a process that evokes consciousness to ideas from the unconscious, or the preconscious area of the brain towards the perceptual field. The process of inspiration enables people to gain access to the use of ideas that are felt to be more elegant, or novel, and thus causes focus and motivation towards more creative behaviour. Research interviews found most of the informants have positive perspectives about themselves. They think that their experience with inspiration is a worthy part of their lives. Most of them think that their experience with inspiration is associated with meeting personal, social and/ or business needs. Inspiration physiologically is usually evoked by a problem that needs to be solved, or as a result of observing recent trends during travelling. In other cases, inspiration happens as a result of using social networks platforms and channels, since networking and meeting new people by different means can raise the opportunities that trigger different whole inspiration mechanisms.

Revising history and reading some success stories or books are found to be highly valuable for better understanding of the biological basis of inspiration (Thrash et. al., 2010). However, it is clear that the body of knowledge needs more work to illuminate the process of how inspiration works to transform ideas into products and solutions that may benefit society. General inspiration is seen in literature as constructs of creative activities which are not totally true. This might help to develop the transcendence of ideas with possibilities of sustained transformation. The presence of Inspiration is found to aid scientific understanding and helps to discover hidden phenomena. Inspiration constructs are found to explain situational dispositioning and high self-regulation. This understanding of the characteristics of inspiration helps to develop its measurement and thus our ability to create and develop it to greater heights.

7.17	 INSPIRATION SCALE
Harding (1948) was one of the earliest who tried to measure and report the feelings of those that experience inspiration and how this experience is critical to their creative processes. Thrash and Elliot (2003) developed a trait measure of inspiration called the Inspiration Scale. Although the term ‚Äútrait‚Äù has a variety of connotations, trait inspiration refers to nothing other than ‚Äúindividual differences in the tendency to experience the state of inspiration‚Äù. Because inspiration is a construct that is meaningful in individuals‚Äô lives, but underappreciated by psychologists, the measure was designed to be straightforward and face valid. Examples of the inspiration constructs used in the popular study of Thrash and Elliot (2003) are: ‚Äúencountering or experiencing something that inspires‚Äù and ‚Äúdo of something due to being inspired‚Äù. The study of Thrash and Elliot established an inspiration scale that has similarly two internally consistent dimensions made of four subscales that measure both inspiration frequency and intensity. Both subscales are internally consistent, with Cronbach‚Äôs Œ±s equal to or greater than .90. The two subscales have been demonstrated to be highly correlated (r = .60 to .80). Therefore, the study of Thrash and Elliot shows that inspiration can be measured by a form of an internally consistent 8-item index that represents overall inspiration. Since scientists may worry that self-reported inspiration cannot be trusted, that it is not objective, or that it does not provide a full explanation, the leading researchers Thrash and Elliot responded to each of the potential limitations of their study. They explained how inspiration tends to be unrelated or weakly related to social desirability, and its predictive validity is robust when social desirability is controlled. To avoid subjectivity the study of Thrash et. al. (2010) dealt with inspiration as an indicator that requires a variety of external criteria and objective outcomes.

As per recent studies inspiration consciousness plays a critical role in the simulation of future action in humans, therefore from this self-report consciousness is found to be a good intrinsic measure and appropriate construct (Baumeister & Masicampo, 2010). The place of inspiration in creativity research paradigms led Buheji et. al. (2014) and other researchers to believe that tests of creative ideation or creative insight can also be another possible type of measure. Implementation of the Inspiration Scale needs to be practical and away from a laboratory setting to allow researchers to focus on the processes underlying the emergence of inspiration. Actually, failure to accommodate the idea actualization process would render our effort for accurate realistic measurement. Since quantitative measurements are made of two approaches being indicators and measures. When it comes to indicators, we can use many different formal and non-formal approaches for measuring inspiration. For example, we can use types of tests called Consensual Assessment Technique (Amabile, 1982) and analysis of patent data, to measure the unique contribution of inspiration.

Buheji et. al.‚Äôs (2014) team of researchers used the following questions to measure inspiration through interviews: 1.	 Tell me about your own experiences with inspiration? 2.	 What about your experience X that inspired you? 3.	 What is the environment related to experience X that inspired you? 4.	 Give me some examples of situations you have been inspired by or inspired others? Did they result in any change? 5.	 What are the characteristics of individuals who inspire you? 6.	 What are the characteristics of environments that inspire you? Buheji et. al.‚Äôs (2014) study continued its inspiration investigation with follow-up questions that were added to the initial questions. Also a series of individually adapted sequential questions as ‚Äútell me more,‚Äù ‚Äúgive some examples‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and so on were used. Each interview took about an hour to conduct and recorded using the record in the smart mobile device with permission of the informant. Questions describing experiences with inspiration that Buheji et. al.‚Äôs (2014) team used stemmed from evidenced based answers relevant to what inspiration is about and why it exists. Meeting personal and business related needs, or being inspired by problems and the need to solve them, or due to travelling around and seeing current trends, or attending seminars and workshops related to business or personal development, or using social network platforms and channels were interesting answers. Using other open questions Buheji et. al.‚Äôs (2014) team focused on measuring the situations that have triggered inspiration. Again interesting inspiration causality answers were participating in decision making, dealing with challenges, reading books and stories, being around highspirited and motivated persons. Measuring characteristics of individuals who create inspiration in one‚Äôs life is one of the value added results of Buheji et. al.‚Äôs (2014) study. Sources of inspiration are different from individual to individual interactions, which is as expected. Many people answered that a leader at home, work or society inspired them. Others reported the role of coaches or mentors in their life. However, all of the participants agree that whoever caused their inspiration have these common traits: persistence, high perseverance, honesty, prudence, accountability and approachability.

7.18	 MEASURES OF AN INSPIRATION ECONOMY‚ÄôS MATURITY
To determine whether an economy promotes greatest good or happiness for people, we need to understand and measure what practices make people or societies happy. Measuring the maturity of an inspiration economy needs to focus on how economic policies enhance the pursuit of happiness in comparison to the current gross domestic product (GDP). Currently maturity of any economy is measured by GDP that counts remedial and defensive expenditures for pollution, accidents, war, crime and sickness as positives, rather than deducting these costs. However, in an inspiration based economy we also need to measure the value of contributions such as natural resources and ecosystem services, improvement in quality of life, unpaid domestic work, volunteer work, good health and social connections. Charles Eisenstein, an economic expert, author of¬†Sacred Economy, and Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, recommend that we should focus on measuring economic policy aims and how they boost societal welfare, rather than GDP. All agree that a new indicator of well-being, such as the U.S. Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), could be used to more accurately measure economic progress.

7.19	 ETHICS OF AN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMY
An ecological economy is one of the main drivers of perceived future economies that pass on values and morality. It is an economy that focuses more on matters of family and community and on building trust which fits in with an inspiration based economy. This is an economy that devotes less attention to maximizing incomes with more attention to acts of generosity and more time off instead of higher pay. Similar to an inspiration economy, the focus of an ecological economy is human behaviour and local communities. With both an ecological and inspired based community, the design of relationship-friendly places such as farmers‚Äô markets, where shoppers engage in more conversations than in supermarket aisles, is a high priority. An ecological economy requires a focused learning environment, which by coincidence an inspiration and learning based economy can create. Practices such as Open Space Technology programmes, World Caf√©s, Transition Towns, Sustainable Cities and Cloud Institutes for Sustainability Education would be highly encouraged. Citizens today in developed countries are cultivating a stronger sense of being one community that realises the value added of tackling local issues through economic goals. The aim is to arrive at a clear-eyed view of what citizens really want from the economy.

Characteristics & Measures of an Inspiration Economy

There are different variables that play a role in developing the ecological economy which integrates with inspiration economy needs such as ecosystem, level of education and the intensity of the role of non-profit organisations. These variables ensure the sustainability of an ecological based economy, besides its inspiration role. These variables also play a role in business, environment and social justice, since they help develop a society‚Äôs health, happiness, true prosperity and sustainability. Such ecological and inspiring based economies are expected to create strong independent socio-economies where small businesses, farmers markets and urban gardens create a source of micro-economies. This type of economy can be seen today in central European countries more than other countries. In such communities the availability and protection of public spaces that enhance social interactions are a sensitive issue. Also, in such communities you will find that small businesses sponsor volunteer local activities since they believe in inspiration that is created from this concept. Citizens who practice in an ecological economy will help to build a better world and to create a quality of life with social justice that will lead to another wave of inspiration.

8	 OUTCOMES OF AN INSPIRING ECONOMY
8.1	 INSPIRED COMMUNITIES
One of the main outcomes from inspiration based economy is society inspiration. Society Inspiration can apply to communities as well as individuals. Inspired communities try to extend a thriving quality of life in peace and harmony that leads to a unique coexistence culture. Usually an inspired community can develop the ability to overcome the obstacles of innovation and competitiveness through persistence for improving their learning cycle. Inspired communities have enablers that boost people‚Äôs willingness and commitment to be inspired then help spread their inspiration to their fellow beings and societies and possibly the rest of the world. The signs of the level of inspiration in a community are the commitment to adding value and creating a meaning for people‚Äôs lives. Such communities are aligned with purpose and the notion of competition along with collaboration. Usually inspired communities have a common vitality with creativity and they have a unique collective social motivation that are shared and experienced by all. Inspired communities believe that every member of the community counts. Such communities believe that being healthy and vibrant communities means abundance in contribution and sharing of knowledge and experience.

8.2	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY AND AGILITY
Inspired communities can be a major source for people and society agility. Agility is a unique competence that works by enhancing the ability to collective awareness of the surrounding environment. Inspiration enhances the possibility for the capture of opportunities and for agile learners who have a willingness to embrace openness. An inspiration economy depends on agile learners who challenge the status quo, remain calm in the face of difficulty, reflect on their experiences and put themselves in challenging positions. This agility requires that we build a community or individuals who are open to learning and resist the temptation to become defensive in the face of adversity, have the capability to separate fact from opinion and treat mistakes as opportunities to learn while contributing to a safe environment.

The spirit of agility recognises complexity based on a cause and effect that analyses facts and links them to current knowledge capability. Based on this people will be inspired to perform a given task and take action as situations evolve. The spirit of agility inspires people to raise their competency through critical thinking, decision making, leadership, entrepreneurial, communication and collaboration skills. In an agile community, the number of patents will be high. Patent-inspiration accomplishes its level of detail through advanced analysis of patent content, in an up-to-date worldwide patent database of 69 million process and product patents. Next to the usual bibliographical and numerical analyses most tools provide, and patent-inspiration offers a quick and easy way to analyse text, yielding information on trends and technology across industries and domains.

8.3	 INSPIRING ORGANISATIONS
Inspiration based economy organisations are unique in how they deal with their employees to get the best out of them with total engagement techniques. Inspiring organisations are usually driven by psychological contracts to help activate individuals‚Äô collective capability. These contracts are inspiring since they are based upon fulfilment of mutual needs. It is a type of contract that defuses the tension between those employers focused on profit, or cost management and an employee focused on job security. Psychological contracts are informed by what is written down (i.e. the official organisational values) and what is observed (i.e. what is said around the water cooler). Inspiring organisations always work around what compels its people and its partners to take action for the good of the organisation. These types of organisations focus on creating an environment for a community that tries to find meaning, to make sense of the world. Often, in today‚Äôs leading world organisations we see that they have the courage to change. In fact, in inspirational organisations all that they do involves change. Such organisations see inspiration hard to copy from one unfounded idea to the next and from recent fad to another. This coincides with the trend that organisations‚Äô survival is more relevant to their ability to make deep-seated changes where they prioritize certain products or service that lead to better outcomes or new practices. Life satisfaction and quality of social relationships are unique characteristics of inspirational organisations. Many authors believe that what some inspiring organisations are doing today, i.e. not only receiving support but also giving support is found to increase a vibrant culture and well-being to a high level (Brown, et. al., 2003).

In a world that never stops changing, great leading inspirational organisations can never stop learning in order to keep evolving and developing. Inspirational organisations are considered as change agents for society. Such organisations are usually culturally sensitive and depend on the level of awareness of its people, on how they are going to inspire their own society. What is unique about these organisations is that they have the spirit of entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship that leads to innovative and resilient outcomes as per figure (8-1). Social responsibility is also part of inspirational organisations where stakeholders focus on a commitment to results. Inspirational organisations are considered as active learners which means having more practices on self-awareness, flexible thinking and developing others. Thus an inspiring organisation is a change agent for society.

The capability for sense-making, problem-solving, decision-making, communication, networking capabilities, as well as the ability to act quickly is what differentiates the competence of these inspiring organisations. Google and many other world inspiring organizations‚Äô horizontal structure are one of the main descriptions of the organization. If one observes the practice of an inspiring organisation‚Äôs culture it is made of three main dimensions: a high communication flow structure, value added appreciation and inspiring practices, as described in Figure (2-5). In such companies you find most staff have a clear life purpose, focus, and self-management, i.e. no supervisors or superiors that monitor how they are doing the work, rather the focus on ‚Äòwhat they are doing‚Äô the peers and team leaders. Value added appreciation is part of the inspiration sustenance mechanism. Inspiring organisations use the concept of abundance as a means to creating ‚Äòpull thinking‚Äô, i.e. high salaries, shares of profits, provision of 24 hours food, laundry, transportation, logistics support, etc. Google, Apple and other similar inspiring companies work under non-punitive schemes, i.e. mistakes are shared and used for development and organization wide learning and reflection than punishment, hiding or as a tool for humiliation. In such organisations high utilization of the relation between innovation and inspiration develops different methodologies for inspiring staff through learning by doing, or learning and play.

With SE we can enhance the adventure and the chance to acquire, at any age, new competencies, know-how, and social skills. Volunteers often undergo training, and this gives them the chance to gain knowledge and skills that can then be used to help find a job, or enjoy the simple pleasures of learning. Social Entrepreneurship gives a chance to increase the volunteering population, thus giving everyone in society a fair chance to be inspired through experiencing the impact of their contribution to society.

8.5	 HERITAGE AND INSPIRATION
Taking care of cultural heritage is a priority in many developed countries today, since it is considered a source of inspiration. Therefore, many countries have citizens who volunteer to protect and maintain cultural and historical values. Today, many leading countries offer focused development and specialised training programmes that target to help the inspiring role of cultural heritage. Through participation in funding, setting of strategies and exhibition management, cultural heritage became a source for inspiration. Heritage workshops that are part of tourism activities, are a main source of inspiration, since they encourage integration between the current and past, team building, intercultural learning, and support consistent accountability towards inspirational development through learning and understanding cross cultures.

Many countries are reviving indigenous cultures. Elders in such communities or one of the indigenous make children repeat poems or credos word for word; games have strict rules; and schools ensure that knowledge of past generations does not disappear with the next. Of course, some societies also value such historical innovation. Alongside, the traditional mode of cultural transmission, there is what Urban calls a modern one.

8.6	 INSPIRATION SHAPING CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETIES
Inspired candidates, most of the time, avoid controlling change in their lives, or in their organisations and/or their societies. Those who create waves of inspiration believe more in Total People Involvement (TPI). TPI supports the efforts of inspiration through a gradual shaping of targeted change through both middle and bottom-up approaches. For inspiration to create an impact, it needs to work in a non-bureaucratic system. Inspiration tries to overcome structured approaches while shaping the way towards more unstructured approaches. Inspiration therefore helps to open more deep dialogue and set up transformative programmes that can shape the desired change. The history of those who are inspired in the world shows that they preferred controlling the steps of change personally to manage the smooth transformation towards what they visualised. The words ‚ÄúShaping of Change‚Äù help to create a new wave of inspiration thus creating a learning environment. Poverty in society increases with wars, conflicts and instability. Recovery from poverty seems to be very difficult with current situations and attempts to alleviate. Symptoms of poverty, as mentioned by John Maynard Keynes, are much more than normal physical poverty, i.e. it is more than wanting things, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness. Poverty today is relevant to the ‚Äòpoverty of aspiration‚Äô. In order to establish a basis for a knowledge-based economy (KE) one needs to overcome particular challenges for humanity in a way for economic poverty to decrease and not increase. Therefore, inspiration can play a role in contributing to both economic and technological development of societies in a KE through the emergence of increasingly symptomatic comparative approaches for socio-economic stability. In their analysis of ‚ÄúCompetitiveness, the KnowledgeBased Economy, and Higher Education,‚Äù Ngai-Ling Sum and Bob Jessop identify the key stages of the development of the modern notions of ‚Äúcompetition/competitiveness‚Äù, and the ‚Äúknowledge-based economy‚Äù, as a new approach to life. Therefore, we see that inspiration still has a vital role to play in helping to identify and protect ‚Äúwhat is important about the life of our society.‚Äù

8.7	 INSPIRATION WITH AGING SOCIETIES
Inspiration is essential today for societies that are suffering from aging. Many elders all over the world are more aware about the need to leave a legacy throughout life journey. They prefer to be independent and lifelong learners. Therefore, having the spirit of inspiration ensures that such people in old age do not feel segregated from their community. By having a clear inspiration role, we can prevent the elderly from being depressed, having anxiety and loss of the value and/or meaning for life. This has already been appreciated by leading governments in Europe. For example, in the UK the active role and feeling of inspiration of those aged 50+ in London with having paid jobs has helped in contributing billions of pounds to the UK government and London‚Äôs economy. Therefore, the UK government has established that older workers and jobseekers must have a fair chance to benefit from the national skills agenda. This experience tells us that we have to recognise and support the social contribution of lifelong learning in its broadest sense. Learning for personal development is an important support and source of inspiration to many elderly people, but it is also a benefit for the wider community. With an inspiration economy certain ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô needs will always be better met than before. It is a continuous rapidly developed economy for the benefit of inspiring people more than anything else. Through the aging community‚Äôs involvement and inspiration; adult learning can keep people active and engaged in the community. Making an elderly person feel that he/she has an active contribution, means we are reducing costs on health and social care services and at the same time getting the socio-economic cycle revived and more vibrant. In an inspiration economy aging society members have the ability to contribute their expertise and talents from diverse locations and feel the energy of living and contributing to life in the wider community. An inspiration economy ensures that all the opportunities for the elderly are open for them to participate and contribute, whether in the working environment or in classes, or even through the internet. Many focus groups and community activities enhance a knowledge based society and are available for an older age group, including enhancing knowledge sharing or the development of community projects.

8.8	 PEOPLE‚ÄôS WELLBEING AND INSPIRATION PERFORMANCE
In an organisation the employees‚Äô wellbeing is very important since it is a measure and reference for the physical and mental health of the workforce (Currie, 2001). The concept of ‚Äòemployee work wellbeing‚Äô boasts advantages to organisations‚Äô by having a healthy, motivated and therefore competitive workforce (Cooper and Robertson, 2011). The major factors driving organizational and individual wellbeing are found to be relevant to open communication, team working, flexibility, support and a balance between work and personal life (Kraybill, 2003).

Inspiration is related to the level of employees‚Äô cognitive ability, which refers to the individual‚Äôs capacity in the organisation to think, reason, and problem solve. Cognitive ability, therefore used to be measured through tests of intelligence and cognitive skills. Until today, cognitive abilities have been found to be the best general predictor of performance across a variety of jobs (Hunter and Schmidt, 1996). In a study undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive Journal (2006) it was found that organizations in the UK needed to pay attention to employee wellbeing and therefore in order to be more productive and competitive could do this by controlling increase in weight, stress and securing employees‚Äô wellbeing by implementation of strategic HR policies that extend employee interests and create inspiration (Brewster and Larsen, 2000; Hailey et. al., 2005). Todd Thrash‚Äôs research discussed in earlier chapters takes a more left-wing approach to wellbeing, starting with the suggestion to focus on an agency that follows the issue of well-being, and then investigate what can be done to intentionally increase well-being. Through an inspirational search it is possible to study what obscures important influences from happening.

Through a series of four linked experiments, Todd Thrash and colleagues showed that when people feel inspired, they are in a better mood¬†(in this case, inspiration is induced by watching between 1 and 2 minutes of the awesome Michael Jordan in action), which increases the positive affect. If you have inspiration as part of your personality, it is likely three months later, your wellbeing increases (as measured by life satisfaction, positive effects, vitality and self-actualization). It appears that inspiration leads to well-being rather than the other way around. Inspiration makes us feel more grateful and to have a higher sense of purpose, and then gratitude and purpose make us feel greater well-being. World class organisations today are measured by their ability to develop their staff wellbeing. Staff wellbeing is about the overall sense of happiness which can be created and seen through attitudes and behaviour. Wright and Nishii (2007) observed that a focus on human ability can draw accurate inferences on performance outcomes. For example, organizational HRM practices focused on increasing knowledge based capacities which were found to be related to employee cognitive responses, i.e. what employees actually experience and see affecting them at work. Cooke (2007) illustrated that many organizations are shifting from vertical to horizontal alignment. Vertical alignment according to Cooke (2007) is where organizations are externally focused on market-positioning strategies; while horizontal alignment is about deploying and integrating HRM policies and practices in ways that maximize their additive and interactive effects on employee competencies and then on their motivation. In a longitudinal study Jiang et. al. (2012) found that motivation for employees is positively related to both administrative and technological services that affect their wellbeing. HRM practices that motivate employees to a sense of autonomy were also found to result in employees being more effective in problem solving and creating new ideas in order to cope with job demands (Jiang et. al., 2012). In a study about traffic controllers; Oakes et. al. (2001) after Schuergerand Watterson (1996) showed how employees who are motivated to the extent to be able to accept criticism and frustration performed better in emergency situations, especially those that involve injuries to passengers and crew, since they needed to be able to remain calm and emotionally detached in order to perform their duties quickly and correctly.

Studies by William James stated that human life‚Äôs main concern is ‚Äòhappiness‚Äô. How to gain, how to keep, how to recover happiness, is in fact for most people the secret motive of all they do, and of all they are willing to endure. The Dalai Lama confirms this by saying ‚ÄúWhether one believes in religion or not, whether one believes in this religion or that religion, the very purpose of our life is happiness, the very motion of our life is towards happiness‚Äù. Inspiration can play a great role in fulfilling this common human goal and can bring them together. Through inspiration we help ourselves and others ‚Äì individuals, communities, and society ‚Äì to become happier. According to Aristotle happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, happiness is the whole aim and end of human existence. Happiness and inspiration are always linked. If people are inspired they most probably can be happy. With the feeling of inspiration we sense we are living every moment. We feel we are gaining value, or able to create something of value. People if they feel they can create value then they can be appreciated. Happiness is functional. Individuals, families, organizations, and societies need happy individuals to flourish. Happy people are more likely to be curious and explore, to take risks and to seek new social contacts and thus can be sustainably inspired.

8.9	 INSPIRING GOVERNMENTS
We are living in a turbulent world and in a period of unprecedented and transformative change. The economy is being globalized and the workforce are becoming more mobilized. Greenleaf (1997) believed it is a world where old organizational pyramids are being replaced by upside-down pyramids where communication and connection roles are changing. For government organisations today any product or service must meet customers‚Äô requirements to be more effective, convenient and affordable. For future governments that want to compete in an inspiration economy people, products, services and facilities need to create a level of a value proposition to inspire the targeted customers and community. The competitiveness of an inspiring government in the future depends on the ways of integrating its resources: training, development and planning to enhance the value proposition to an optimum level. Governments with a strong leadership-team will enjoy revenue growth (Holden, 2003). In 1997, only about half of all employees in a survey rated their organization‚Äôs leadership as excellent or good. Inspiration therefore is important since it motivates us towards the realization of ideas (Sadoski and Paivio, 2001). Today, many governments are establishing clear accountability programmes where the main role is the practice of gratitude and positive thinking. The more governments have a role in establishing optimism through establishing proper social internal welfare programmes and investing in social relationships and responsibility schemes, the more inspiration will be sustained in such a culture.

Certain governments are trying to establish a path towards inspiration through holding training programmes such as the management of stress, hardship and trauma; however this does not help to establish proper inspiration. Other governments are beginning to develop strategies that cope with trends and challenges that will be targeted in organisational problem-focused programmes. In an inspiration economy, governments compete in increasing the experience flow through total involvement. Governments focus on creating a life of joy and establishing a realisation that shows how to care for the body and soul. The future will focus on how governments create and maintain inspiration. With an inspiration economy government, one need to be more conscious about its future ability to inspire coming generations which are the natural resource of a country‚Äôs treasures. Thomas Jefferson (1809) once said ‚ÄúThe care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the only legitimate object of good government‚Äù. Therefore, it is common sense that we ask that governments should be measured by their ability and moral commitment to factor people into the study of economics, human wealth, social wealth and environmental wealth.

Governments in developed countries have started to feel the pressure of the new meaning of real development that involves people‚Äôs happiness. Profiles of happiness in the last few years have been ‚Äúflat‚Äù in developed countries while they have stayed very low in oppressed and developing countries. Andrew Clark et. al. (2008) carried out a survey on happiness that identified seven factors contributing to happiness which governments have a main role in creating, these are: family relationships, financial situation (income), job satisfaction, social environment, health, personal freedom and life philosophy.

8.10	 INSPIRATION AND RESILIENCE
Inspiration creates a spirit that helps people to survive the most difficult of circumstances through resilience. Resilience is defined as the capability of individuals to cope successfully in the face of significant change, adversity or risk (McAdams, 1982; McClelland & Kirshnit, 1988). Through viewing a film about an inspiring leader, a positive immunological response can occur in any of us (McClelland and Kirshnit, 1988). Then it could be said that inspiration causes happiness since our built-in resilience lets us see that no matter what happens in life, we would return to our natural set point if we are focused and persistent. Life satisfaction does not happen by coincidence, it happens only when we find meaning in our lives. Resilience is important for an inspiration economy, since inspiration causes motivational enhancement for people of all ages, thus causing empathy practices that differentiate between goals and behaviours to avoid argumentation. Inspired citizens are usually active people who promote the comprehensive development of the countries they serve. Inspiration creates this spirit of high resilience in citizens that leads to researching for the truth, while strengthening analytical capabilities. The spirit of resilience inspires us, since we are always in a medium of promoting coexistence or managing a dialogue. Since inspiration is not limited to the level of the economy, language, gender, or authenticity, it is expected to enhance resilience in order to continuously manage the change of the shape of economic status for many countries. Thus with resilience inspiration survives in cities or rural areas. With both inspiration and resilience competitiveness can be flexibly used to provide more opportunity for reducing poverty through techniques such as appreciative enquiry and positive activation.

Since economic development needs perspiration, persistence and hard work an inspiration economy is not productivity driven, but rather development driven, and therefore is it independent from resources and is more resilient. The development of a resilient inspiration economy is about the capacity of the organisation, or society towards reaching discovery that sustains real competition and surpasses obstacles. With inspiration learning that is resilient and past learning from failures is clearer and highly absorbed. In a resilient community the majority of the people can build self-confidence to be more independent and create their own fate. If an inspiration economy is established it helps to control the epidemic of economic inequality that has increased in the last 30 years. With inspiration we reduce the threat to both political and economic systems, as people feel they are empowered and socially coherent. The spirit of resilience, if it combines inspiration initiatives and ideas, turns to a level of analysis that leads to actions. Such initiatives may be so strong that it they encourage a dialogue between government, the private sector and civil society. Inspiration once it meets resilience it unleashes a force similar to an entrepreneurship spirit, and thus participates in reducing poverty and contributes to human development in many ways. The more inspiration is implemented in reality means more profits that fuel economic growth directly and indirectly. For example, more inspiration means more decent jobs that guarantee vitality. With resilience meeting inspiration we will have better consumer driven goods and services and/or more choices and opportunities for all. The integration of resilience with the spirit of inspiration, people will not be ill-equipped for the marketplace, since they have a sustainable livelihood and benefit from market interactions. The spread of inspiration resilience actually demonstrates how doing business with the poor can be good for poor people and good for business. Inspiration promotes business models that create value by providing products and services to, or sourcing from, the poor. Through inspiration resilience the world will focus and develop towards providing central actors who establish opportunities for the poor. To sharpen this focus local knowledge shifts from the ever-growing network of development practitioners, policymakers, business people and civil society actors to normal people.

The UN millennium development goals focused on expanding people‚Äôs choices to lead lives that they value. Towards this understanding comes the importance of resilience and inspiration and their role in fighting poverty. Thus the UNDP initiative for establishing a human development framework enhances its ability to do business with the poor through focusing on the development of an inspiration spirit to foster real economic empowerment. Unleashing inspiration resilience through international programmes make people foster their multi-stakeholder capacity.

8.11	 BENEFITS OF AN INSPIRATION BASED ECONOMY
It is worth repeating that inspiration will not be only a fuelling source for an economy, but also a source for the individual well-being and quality of life, through establishing the following benefits to the individuals and the community: One ‚Äì Setting a Clear Life Purpose Thrash et. al. (2010) contend that a purpose in life and gratitude should mediate the association between inspiration and wellbeing. These authors maintain that inspiration should instil a purpose in life. A purpose in life emerges when individuals feel connected to something that transcends the self (Seligman, 2002). Furthermore, a purpose in life emanates from the pursuit of valued goals that seem to be inherently or intrinsically significant (Emmons, 1999).

Two ‚Äì Awareness of Unrecognised Opportunities Inspiration implies an awareness of unrecognized opportunities; individuals feel they can transcend the self, which is integral to a purpose in life. Similarly, the motivation to promulgate, or actualize this awareness implies that insight is intrinsically important and valuable. Thus, inspiration should instil a sense of purpose in life (Thrash, et.al. 2010), which is often regarded as a key source of wellbeing (Keyes, Shmotkin, and Ryff, 2002). Three ‚Äì Inspiration Establishes Gratitude Inspiration comes more with gratitude where individuals feel they receive a gift. Once we experience a gain, or a benefit that can be attributed to someone else we have inspiration (Solomon, 1983). Inspiration implies that individuals become aware and start to realise desirable opportunities around them and this is associated with their wellbeing (Adler et. al., 2005). Thrash et. al. (2010) assessed how clear goals and aims help individuals to feel grateful and thankful. Therefore, Thrash and Elliot (2004) distinguished between two main processes in inspiration, and these are ‚Äòinspired by‚Äô and ‚Äòinspired to‚Äô. The first process where we have ‚Äòinspired by‚Äô we feel appreciation and recognition of opportunity, possibility, insight, awareness, and understanding. The second process is ‚Äòinspired to‚Äô where we have the urge to extend, disseminate, utilize, and promulgate this opportunity. These two processes complete each other and lead to a dynamical circulation that affects our life contributions and socio-economies. There is a high possibility in the opinion of Thrash and Elliot (2004) that individuals can be ‚Äòinspired by‚Äô something, but not ‚Äòinspired to‚Äô act in response to it.

8.12	 INSPIRATION LEADS TO INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY
While there is considerable variability in the definition and usage of the term creativity within psychology (Silvia and Kaufman, 2010), there is some degree of consensus that creativity implies two qualities: novelty and usefulness (e.g.,¬† Feist, 1998; Plucker et. al., 2004). We find it useful to explicitly conceptualize creativity as an¬†appraisal¬†of novelty and usefulness that may be applied to any of a variety of objects, particularly ideas and resulting products. Depending on the aims of the research, this appraisal may be made by the creator her/himself, by gatekeepers within a field, by an audience, or through various other operationalizations available to the researcher. We note that researchers often appear to have either ideas or products in mind as the ultimate objects of creativity appraisals, even when the term ‚Äúcreative‚Äù precedes other nouns (e.g., creative activity (Simonton, 2000), creative insights (Csikszentmihalyi and Sawyer, 1995), creative personalities (Feist, 2010), creative states (Jamison, 1989), or creative processes (Kris, 1952)).

Although the terms inspiration and creativity have occasionally been used synonymously (e.g.,¬†Schuler, 1994; Chamorro-Premuzic, 2006), our conceptualizations of inspiration and creativity involve a clear delineation. Creativity is an appraisal of novelty and usefulness that may apply (to various degrees) to content at any point in the creative process, from a seminal idea to the completed product. Inspiration, in contrast, is a motivational state. We posit that inspiration is often elicited when a creator appraises his or her idea as creative, and it is posited to motivate actualization of the idea in the form of a product that is likewise appraised (by its creator and perhaps others) as creative. We discuss empirical support for these proposals below. The field of creativity assessment is active and dynamic, and thus a review of the literature is well beyond the scope of this handbook (for a review, see¬†Plucker and Makel, 2010). We note, however, that the dominant research paradigms used in the study of creativity have unwittingly precluded attention to inspiration. Creativity is most often assessed using tests of creative ideation (e.g., Alternate Uses) or creative insight (e.g., Remote Associates Test). While such tests are practical in laboratory contexts and allow researchers to focus on the processes underlying the emergence of creative ideas, they do not allow participants to transform creative ideas into creative products. Failure to accommodate the idea actualization process‚Äîthat is, creation¬†per se‚Äîrenders inspiration speciously immaterial to the creative process. If the function of inspiration within the context of creativity is the actualization of creative ideas into creative products, useful paradigms must allow for idea actualization. Product-based assessments, such as the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT;¬†Amabile, 1982) and analysis of patent data, are the gold standard if one wishes to investigate the unique contribution of inspiration to the creative process.¬† In fact, relevance to inspiration aside, assessment of creative products is considered by some to be the most appropriate and valid operationalization of creativity (Baer et. al., 2004; Baer and McKool, 2009). Having established a relation between inspiration and creativity, we now consider the role of ‚Äúperspiration‚Äù in the creative process. Notably,¬†Thrash et. al. (2010b)¬†documented a positive relation, rather than a negative relation, between inspiration and effort, indicating that these constructs are not mutually exclusive as the Edison quote may imply. The assumption that the presence of effort indicates low levels of inspiration is further challenged by a positive relation between inspiration and the work-mastery component of need for achievement (Thrash and Elliot, 2003). Both of these findings were documented at two statistically independent levels of analysis (between-persons, within-persons).

Certainly effort is important to the creative process, but its role is different to that of inspiration. Whereas writers‚Äô inspiration predicts the creativity of the product, writers‚Äô effort predicts the technical merit of the product (Thrash et. al., 2010b). Thus inspiration and effort are unique predictors of different aspects of product quality. Moreover, screen capture data indicate that inspiration is involved in the automatic/generative aspects of the writing process (e.g., inspired writers produce more words and retain more of their original typing), whereas effort is related to controlled self-regulation (e.g., writers who exert effort delete more words and pause more to think;¬†Thrash et. al., 2010b). In short, inspiration and ‚Äúperspiration‚Äù are not mutually exclusive, and they contribute in qualitatively different ways to the creative process and product. With the use of positive psychology, the science of inspiration encourages the usage of diverse literatures in a multiple populations setting with different contexts which provide a solid foundation for creative and innovative approaches that use the combination of both neuroscience and inspiration. This combination enhances the uniqueness learnt merely by analogical thinking. It is something we hope students will acquire on their own, in or out of school.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Outcomes of an Inspiring Economy

The focus on inspiration leads to new ways of teaching innovation despite limitations of resources. An inspiration driven economy influences people to focus on striving to produce the most suitable products and/or services, through more multi-disciplined entrepreneurs and innovators. In the last few years, the great economic recession has shown the importance of an ‚Äòattitude driven‚Äô economy. Inspiration plays an important role in re-engineering concepts and attitudes in order to establish better crisis management capabilities. In an inspirational based economy we will be cultivating a sense of civic duty and citizenship, through preparing the youth to strive for humanity driven standards, and not only excellence driven standards through developing a sense of compassion in all the cognitive related decisions. Once we establish inspired communities with a high sense of people‚Äôs belonging we can foster clear contributions. Many inspirational societies can be modelled through a new style of grounded liberal arts education. The outcome of the mix of liberal arts and entrepreneurship develops personal identity thus creating an influence on the larger social context Godwyn (2009). Innovation in an Inspiration Economy will be differentiated from the past and today‚Äôs innovations due to supporting ‚Äúwhole-brain‚Äù teaching and research practices, as opposed to the usual ‚Äúleft-brain‚Äù innovations. Art, music and literature portfolios will become part of the science and engineering application processes. By this we will have an innovation inspiration mix, that provides the best of right-brain thinking, such as artistry, intuition, symbology, fantasy, and emotions. In a study conducted by Harvard Medical School, statistics of students who spend more time using the right sides of their brain gain more knowledge and ability to solve problems than students who focus on left brain teaching only. Dr. Joel Katz, of Harvard Medical School, and his team had a group of first- and second-year students spend a little over half their weekly class time at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, in classes and workshops on art, and the remaining hour in lectures, for a course on physical diagnosis (Naghshineh et. al. 2008). A control group, meanwhile, attended the lectures, but did not join in the museum visits. At the end of the eight-week term, the students who participated in the art classes made 38% more positive observations than the students in the control group.

The traditional cultural objects undergo as little change as possible in the act of transmission, during an inspiration economy. This sustains and reproduces cultural objects for the next generation. For example, the traditional repetition of folk songs over centuries has also been modified with modern music flavours to enhance acceptance among other cultures. Thus regardless of the discipline, there will be attempts to modify an existing body of knowledge through the integration of the spirit of both innovation and inspiration. Again if we take the example of curricular requirements where the majority of courses focus on reproducing knowledge in students, neurobiology may be a field in flux, but before you can study the interaction of synapses, you need a solid foundation in biochemistry. Classes in the humanities not only offer students the best opportunities to practice innovative thinking, but also provide them with models for how to do so. Professors, after all, are not simply there to transmit discrete data packages about books, compositions, theories, or events, but rather to show students how one goes about piecing together an argument and narrative around a subject. Professors ‚Äúperform innovation‚Äù when they offer, say, a political reading of Hamlet, an economic interpretation of the American Revolution, or a Hegelian analysis of Marx. Hence in an inspiration economy students are expected to practice innovative thinking earlier in their studies. Although there is a large difference in outcome between story writing and the development of new software, both rely on holistic cognitive processes. Students will be exposed to these processes more often in humanities than in science or engineering classes. Christensen et. al. (2011) describe how disruptive innovation will change the way the world learns which is one of the most important references for an inspiration economy school. Without disruption in the innovation process supported by an inspiration spirit we can find the appropriate formula for a school, by teaching students in a dynamic and turbulent market. Christensen emphasises that schools under the influence of disruptive innovation are responsive to society‚Äôs needs. Once disruptive innovation practices are integrated with inspiration, on a road map towards transforming societies and economies, we witness floods of ideas. Global thinking mixed with critical and analogical thinking, supported by collaboration, contextual learning, information and media literacy, e-skills and life skills are all constructs for disruptive innovation. Also, schools in support of an inspiration economy foster entrepreneurial literacy and risk taking. The influence of inspiration on research and innovation can be more clear due to the knowledge and learning economy which is growing and creating a shift towards competitiveness based research funding. Also, there is an increased reliance on private financing and international academic mobility and collaboration.

The growth in research output is expected to double due to inspiration‚Äôs role in innovation. Besides, the output of research will be more value added compared to expenditure. To have a creative research output, one must have the inspiration, ability and experience to execute it.

8.13	 INSPIRATION‚ÄôS INFLUENCE ON NPOS
Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) are considered one of the three main contributors to a developed economy. A future inspiration economy will depend on the development of the NPO sector to sustain and be part of the norm. The relationship between producer and consumer in NPO‚Äôs is much more a gift-exchange than a purchase-and-sale relationship. A¬†non-profit organization¬†(NPO) would have surplus¬†revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission and this requires unique inspiration practices that differentiate it from both the public and private sector.

The inspiration that a NPO shows towards its members or the community it is serving will be unique. Already today, inspiration differentiation in an NPO‚Äôs services is what make them more than one third of the USA economy and probably one fourth of the UK and developed countries economies, directly or indirectly. With member serving organizations, such as NPOs, mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired employees clubs, etc., all community-serving organizations will be focused on providing services to the community; however in an inspiration economy it will also focus in inspiring the community to discover potential through the art of giving. Organizations delivering human service programmes or projects, aid and development programmes, medical research, education and health services, are expected to report generated surplus revenues, besides inspiration made in the community or target group. NPOs are expected to be pivotal to a societies shift towards an inspiration economy besides education, since NPOs can influence projects relevant to culture, language, art and resilience.

9	INSPIRATION ECONOMY AND FUTURE COMPETING ECONOMIES
9.1	 MANAGEMENT OF INSPIRATION PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES
Around the World, projects and initiatives are developed every day under the name of inspiration. Inspirational driven projects are currently time-bound with high expectations that often fail to meet what is actually perceived. Therefore, it is advisable to have short-term pilot projects with the potential to address a specific dissatisfaction through a tested model that once successful can be generalised based on a formula of change management and transformation that say: Realised Inspiration = A √ó M √ó P Realised inspiration is the resultant of (A) Awareness of the need for change, (M) Model undertaken for transformation toward the targeted change and (P) Process of managing inspiration continuity. While managing (P) there will be potential to discover what works and what does not, or it needs a particular way to work and sustain inspiration. Experience indicates that there are no quick fixes, inspiration needs dedication to sustain. There are many programmes that started as a model today which have enabled many communities and leaders to inspire their societies to make real changes. Through a realised inspiration formula many have gained the confidence to generalise the model of inspiration. In Nepal for example, the utilisation of realised inspiration techniques helped to increase the hours for health centres, more medicines and greater access to antenatal and midwife services. Also, such techniques helped improve the management of schools thus enhancing children‚Äôs valued education. The Nepal women voice programme was another initiative that focused on a model that inspired change in women‚Äôs rights. The model had clear key success factors that focused on having speaking and listening skills as vital aspects of literacy learning and vehicles towards empowerment. Also, the model gave a chance to Nepali‚Äôs to reflect on the importance of having a better environment for women to raise issues and share concerns, as they can really add value to society‚Äôs ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô.

In order to maintain this inspiration process the Nepali government and NGO‚Äôs involved key community influencers who helped to make sure inspiration empowerment strategies support women. During inspiration projects or initiatives you will sense and manage change signals at the project, society or organisation‚Äôs boundaries. You need to be able to capture this as an opportunity and do it quickly. To manage the process of inspirational sustenance you need to lower levels of complexity and improve knowledge capability. To preserve the inspirational value that is reliant on knowledge capability we need to continually enhance our anticipation and innovation capacity.

9.2	 A HOLISTIC APPROACH AND INSPIRATION
Life cannot develop with specialization and sub-specialization only. Life needs both specialization and non-specialization tracks and hybrid paradox tracks that make us see the big picture. With a specialization track one can only solve important complex life problems, and with a hybrid track only, we can achieve detailed planned developed inspiration. Therefore, both are needed.

Today, however, due to life being on a fast basis of development and due to special tracks education in most countries has lost holistic thinking, which is a main source for inspiration. Due to its power, holistic thinking can uncover blind spots around us. This holistic thinking used to be the source of excitement for many scientists between the time of Ibn Sinatill and Einstein.

9.3	 INSPIRATION AND THE TRANSITION ECONOMY¬†
True transition economics should include both micro and macro transition.¬†The term¬†transition period¬†is often used to describe the process of transition from capitalism to socialism, preceding the establishment of fully developed socialism. Inspiration flourishes in a transition economy. A¬†transitional economy¬†usually has socio-economic changes in its practices, due to the shift from a¬†centrally planned economy¬†to a¬†market based economy.¬†Transition economies undergo a set of structural transformations where prices become controlled by market forces rather than by central planning. Inspiration is a mediator to ease tension between both. A transitional economy¬†has become especially important since the collapse of Communism in¬†Central and Eastern Europe. Transition economics investigates how an economy should reform itself to endorse capitalism and democracy. The transition process is usually characterized by changing and creating institutions whether these are government, private and/or NGOs.¬†In essence, a transition mode is the functional restructuring of state institutions, for example, from being a provider of growth to an enabler, with the private sector its engine. Another transition mode is changing the way an economy grows and in terms of its practice mode. In both cases, an inspiration economy can play a role in speeding up this transformation.

9.4	 INSPIRATION AND THE SERVICE ECONOMY
The service economy is a relatively new term arising out of the popularity of the service sector. The service sector has gained a lot of importance in the World economy. Most of the developed countries are earning millions from the service sector alone. In the USA, for example, the service sector accounts for a greater percentage of GDP than it used to a couple of years back. The term service economy also known as ‚Äòfunctional economy‚Äô is used to refer to the relative significance of services attached to a product offered by a company (OECD, 2000). In today‚Äôs economy every product has a service value attached to it, in an inspiration economy we believe that those products would also have an inspirational value. When a company proceeds from maximizing its sales towards customer satisfaction it must give emphasis to inspiration as an aspect of service. This would help enhance company goodwill in the market besides increasing its productivity.

Product-life extension is a good example of where a service economy integrates with inspiration. The product-life extension scheme is a source of inspiration since it reduces material and energy consumption required to satisfy the needs of consumers, while also enhancing productivity per unit. Enhancement in resource productivity is eventually transformed into competency and profitability. Another example of integration between service and inspiration economies is the case of IBM. In spite of IBM being a manufacturing company it tends to call itself a services company . This has been the scenario since it realized that the price elasticity of demand for business solutions is less elastic than for hardware. The company now benefits from this inspiration based technique with revenue that has elongated its contracts and enhanced its variety of products and service rather than receiving payment in a single mode. Studies reveal that service economy jobs can enjoy double productivity through better application of information technology; again this can be a source of inspiration where we can produce double employee productivity. Inspiration is a good agent enhancing the productivity of a service economy. The importance of an inspired based service economy is even more important in developing countries since it is still resource dependent. Inspiration causes hospitality,¬†retail,¬†health,¬†human,¬†financial, information technology¬†and¬†education services to be more independent. In the future due to inspiration and service economy integration many Indian health companies will be carrying out back-office services of a US hospital, such as scanning services. There will be development of many integrated technology or healthcare services and tourism packages such as those in South Africa, Thailand and South Korea.

9.5	 INSPIRATION AND THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
The application of powerful social technology has helped many people around the World to realise the reality of a knowledge economy (KE) which simply enhances the power of choice using knowledge and technology. The knowledge economy has many practices that lead to inspiration for concerned knowledge capital. One of the most inspiring aspects of a KE is how it deals with the economic model of human behaviour, as knowledge capital.

Knowledge capital (KC) focuses on how people act when they carry and maintain or even acquire knowledge, thus creating the possibility for inspiration. The law of demand for KC is that it can be a separate independent good, or activity, or it can be part of another good or activity that raises the particular good or activity. The dynamics of KC knowledge accumulation helps to enhance the concepts of capacity and demand that help the economy to adjust to changing scarcities and raises the possibility for people to discover their intrinsic power to be inspired. A key concept of the knowledge economy is that knowledge and education (often referred to as ‚Äúhuman capital‚Äù) can be treated as one of the following: business product, as educational and innovative intellectual products and services can be exported for a high value return. A KE can be defined as a production and services based economy that is inspired by knowledgeintensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technical and scientiÔ¨Åc advance, as well as rapid obsolescence. The key component of a knowledge economy is a greater reliance on intellectual capabilities than on physical inputs or natural resources.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Inspiration Economy and Future Competing Economies

It has been suggested that the next evolutionary step after a knowledge economy is the¬†network economy, where relatively localized knowledge is shared amongst and across various networks for the benefit of the network members as a whole, to gain economies of scale in a wider, more open form. A knowledge economy differs from the traditional economy in several key respects: The economics are not of scarcity, but rather abundance. Unlike most resources that become depleted when used, information and knowledge can be shared, and actually grow through application. A KE transforms economies from a mindset of scarcity to abundance, and it is considered a mediator towards an inspiration economy, i.e. no economy can transfer easily to an inspiration economy if it‚Äôs mind set has been shifted to the belief of the abundance of resources. Knowledge as a currency can be managed to where demand is highest and barriers lowest. Therefore today ‚Äòknowledge enhanced‚Äô products or services can command price premiums over comparable products with low embedded knowledge or knowledge intensity. The pricing and value of products and services in a KE are becoming dependent on the context. The same information or knowledge can have a different value to different people, or even to the same person at different times. Knowledge locked into systems or processes has a higher inherent value than when it can ‚Äúwalk out of the door‚Äù in people‚Äôs heads. However, if such knowledge is not valued, transformed or trapped, then it will not be of value at all. Here inspiration economy practices are most useful. Once inspiration is integrated within a knowledge economy it has various forms in which it may appear.

9.6	 INSPIRATION AND THE LEARNING ECONOMY
Modern economies can be characterised as¬†learning economies¬†where knowledge is a crucial resource and learning is the most important process. Different kinds of learning and economically relevant types of knowledge can likewise be identified. It is argued that pure¬†market economies, if such exist, have problems in terms of learning and innovation. The ‚Äòlearning economy‚Äô is a¬†mixed economy¬†in a fundamental sense and it requires the spirit of persistence that comes with an inspiration based economy. For several reasons many prefer the term ‚Äòthe learning economy‚Äô in characterising the current phase of socio-economic development. A learning economy meets a KE in the need of having practices of a networking economy. The ‚Äúlearning economy‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial learning‚Äù appear to be promising mediators towards a well established inspiration economy.

Lundvall developed his vision of ‚Äòthe learning economy‚Äô (Lundvall and Johnson, 1994) and, particularly, the role of national institutions, education and training systems, and labour markets for learning and improving economic performance. Therefore, knowledge and learning, as a public good, are characterised by being non-rival and non-excludable. Arrow and Nelson (circa 1960) noted knowledge as a public good which calls for government intervention. Marshall (circa 1920) with regard to an industrial district perceived knowledge as local and not easy to move from one place to another. The learning economy can be characterised as a more rapid transformation, with shorter product life cycles, and a shorter life time for competences. A LE is considered a source of inspiration which can be continuously enhanced depending on the level of networking in organisations. In a LE one expects to have more learning organisations that are flatter and allow more horizontal communication inside and outside organisational borders, establish cross- departmental and functional teams and promote job-circulation between functions. Such organisations are also described as inspiring organisations. Operational dimensions of the learning organization depend on inspiration based practices. For example, there is a need to practice in cross occupational working groups, have integration of functions, enhance the sharing of responsibility, or build self-directed teams. All of these practices can be seen in an inspiration economy. A learning economy can be seen as a mediator between Innovation and knowledge management. A LE similar to inspiration is based on diversity within the organisation and co-existence of different kinds of education.

9.7	 INSPIRATION AND THE ENTREPRENEURIAL ECONOMY
Inspiration, innovation and entrepreneurship are always a common thread. This involves the ability to observe and capture opportunities. All of these three sister economies are dependent on the practices of education. All can be corrupted by the same education system. The entrepreneurial mindset prefers flexibility, similar to an inspired mindset, in order to look for a genuine opportunity. Inspiration of the self-employed¬†helps them to be more driven to contribute time with persistence by employing themselves rather than working for someone else. The spirit of inspiration once captured by entrepreneurs makes them unique in marketing their services. Even franchisees, who have the support of a proven system, can find themselves lost unless they have a spirit of inspiration. Many home based businesses, consultants, coaches and service start-ups would not have been successful without the spirit of persistence.

Having an entrepreneurial mindset in an economy enables the socio-economy to have multiple profit centres. The entrepreneurial economy helps people who know how to make the most of every opportunity and brings new prospects while converting them to paying clients, and for them to buy repeatedly. Developing such an entrepreneurial mindset in societies is one of the best self-development economic programmes in the World. Brown (2014) discussed how entrepreneurs think and thrive in an unpredictable economy. In the past if you studied and worked hard, you could be assured of a satisfying career. But in a world of constant layoffs and dying industries, it has become increasingly difficult to ‚Äúplan‚Äù success. So what is the solution? When dealing with uncertainty, no one handles it better than successful entrepreneurs. That is why you want to take the same approach they do! Based on extensive research and interviews,¬†Own Your Future¬†shows how to apply the simple model they use ‚Äì Act. Learn. Build. Repeat ‚Äì to reinvent the way to manoeuvre in an unpredictable job market. Here is how it works. Instead of picturing a perfect career and working backwards, simply begin with the direction you want to go and take a small step. Thinking alone will never change your life ‚Äì you must act. Then evaluate the lessons you learn from that first step, build on them, and take another step in your desired direction. Repeat this process until you have achieved your goal.

9.8	 INSPIRATION AND THE HOMO ECONOMY
The homo economy, or¬†the economic human, is the economics concerned with the production of goods and services. In¬† economics it is the concept that attempts to maximize utility as a consumer and economic profit as a producer.¬† With inspiration the human being can be sustainably motivated to cooperate and improve their environment while focusing on value added as a producer. The homo economy¬†optimises perceived opportunities where the individual seeks to attain specific and pre-determined goals to the greatest extent with the least possible cost which coincides with inspiration economy expectation. Thus the homo economy complements the inspiration economy in trying to optimise intrinsic capabilities of the human towards the betterment of the socio-economy.

9.9	 INSPIRATION AND THE PURPLE ECONOMY
The¬†purple economy¬†is that part of the¬†economy¬†which contributes to¬†sustainable development¬†by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services. The purple economy focuses on using cultural aspects in economics which the inspiration economy has a major stake in. Both purple and inspiration economies have practices that adapt both co-existences and diversity as part of the cultural value that differentiate goods and services from those countries. For example, we still differentiate products that are made in Japan from the same products of the same company which come from China or Malaysia due to the purple value they carry for us. The more we create an inspiration for each community that differentiates its purple value the more we will have a rainbow competitive and sustainable global economy. The integration of the human diversity dimension as a vertical dimension, and the cultural dimension as a horizontal dimension, in the purple economy, leads to cultural vitality. Similar to the inspiration economy, the purple economy is multidisciplinary, since it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. Many recent International agencies, such as UNESCO and OECD, have started to focus on the purple economy to make civil society more inspired with the phenomenon of culturalization, affecting entire socio-economic practices. A positive aspect about the integration of both inspiration and purple economies is that they lead to a high flow of new jobs, called purplifying professions.

9.10	 INSPIRATION AND THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY
The experience economy is the latest level in the evolution of commercial exchange which began when mankind started bartering one thing in exchange for another. The dominance of essential commodities that are value added is what makes an experience economy. An example of this is raw metal (commodity) becoming an automobile (good). The exchange of goods enjoyed a lengthy market reign, but in turn, they were replaced as the dominant economic driver by the arrival of the service industry, which was essentially a product with value added. The service industry has enjoyed its own durable history as the defining market force. Customers today are now willing to pay for a new level of added value, including experience. In a competitive market, a car repair service that merely provides a mechanic and a service bay will struggle to survive without augmenting experiences such as a customer viewing platform, a manned snack bar, a waiting area with plasma TV, high-speed internet access with free Wi-Fi, a drive-thru option, at-home pickup or complimentary car rental. These practices are important in an inspiration based economy as they are both opportunity for focus and also opportunity for discovering the intrinsic strengths within each service. The experience economy focuses on creating a feel of inspiration for the targeted beneficiaries. Thus buying olive oil from a supermarket will not provide the same feeling and experience as olive oil provided by a high end restaurant while cooking the food for taste. Thus we buy a service, and a set of intangible activities carried out on our behalf, but if we are willing to pay more for an experience, because we are short of time, or because we want to spend on the best, enjoying memorable events, we are really buying an experiential service. This type of service most probably would help us to see, or miss opportunities as compared to the traditional service. When you choose to go to or deal with a Walt Disney World Resort and not any other resort you are applying the practices of the experience economy. This why Steve Jobs insisted on differentiating his products through Apple retail store to discover businesses that ensured their economic strength and customer loyalty by providing exceptional connections and experiences. Companies that are in the business of delivering experiences can point to clients who are advocates of economic growth through word-of-mouth, employees who are inspired, and durability during difficult economic times.

Once Inspiration and experience of economic practices integrates they can be a source of differentiation between businesses which merely provides customers with what they have come to expect and those which engage customers in highly personal, memorable and engaging ways. Therefore, it would be a mistake ‚Äì and a critical opportunity lost ‚Äì to dismiss the relevance and applicability of the experience economy to one‚Äôs business, regardless of the goods or services it happens to provide. Inspiration and experience might meet, for example, when we are providing a customer a product along with kind words, a pleasant smell or under a nice shade or while sitting and enjoying or even meditating a nice view. Inspiration and experiences are both memorable not because of what they cost, but because they both engage us and we perceive something of high value in our life journey. Given this challenge of differentiated feeling between a traditional service and experience inspiring service, we need to create specialists that can ‚Äòengineer experiences‚Äô or ‚Äòboost inspiration of the experiences‚Äô. An experience economy is different to an inspiration economy, since it requires many prerequests. i.e. in an experience economy it is important to know what customers are looking for. By understanding these expectations, the concerned party will create experiences that can be transformative according to a certain designed criteria.

In order to create competitive inspiring experiences, we need to engage customers in the process of service design. Customers in this type of economy will be more inspired because they will know that what they will receive, either as a product, service or experience, will be provided every time. This approach was followed by McDonald‚Äôs restaurants across the World. There is only one Big Mac and one way of doing it. Customers therefore trust that they can obtain it anywhere in the World every time. This is an economy that values experience and needs specialists like ‚Äòexperienced engineers‚Äô who use imagineering, inspiration, innovation, and knowledge acceleration techniques in order to fulfil customers wants. Once any organisation manages to create proper imagination then inspiration most probably follows. Due to the relations between experience, inspiration and innovation, the home entertainment industry has been redesigned to utilise innovation to change the viewing experience thus creating more possibility for inspiration. Experience and inspiration economies when they are taken holistically in a business design leads to acceleration. Both experience and inspiration economies have vibrancy based goals, for themselves, for their users and for society. They are economies that are dependent and target trust, transparency and engagement. In 1953, Walt Disney drafted a proposal to secure funding for a new theme park he envisioned based on the secret formula of experience and inspiration and wrote: ‚ÄúThe idea of Disneyland is a simple one. It will be a place for people to find happiness and knowledge.‚Äù

9.11	 INSPIRATION, WELLBEING AND THE GENUINE WEALTH ECONOMY
The economics of inspiration is linked to a new term in nature and spirit, called the concept of ‚Äògenuine wealth‚Äô by Anielski (2007). The Genuine Wealth model is based on questioning the essence of the conventional definitions of ‚Äúwealth‚Äù in comparison to ‚Äúvalue‚Äù. Genuine Wealth meets Inspiration Economy principles since they both consider developing better systems and instruments for measuring human progress while exploring the goodness in people.

As Robert Kennedy mentioned, GNP might be good at adding up all government money and public spend on goods and services in an economy, but it is a ‚Äúlousy‚Äù measure of what matters to most citizens in terms of quality of life. While Genuine Wealth, according to Anielski (2007), considers creating a system of ‚Äúwell-being accounting‚Äù that measures the physical and qualitative conditions of well-being, including happiness. Genuine wealth involves new forms of capital accounting: human capital (time, knowledge, and health), plus social capital (trust and strength of relationships) which integrate with inspiration economy principles. This integration is especially true when we see that wealth is meant to be the conditions of well-being that are the core values of the individual, organisation, or society life journey. Inspirations in society will not be sustained and absorbed without both human and social capital. The work of Anielski (2007) is considered important for not only genuine wealth simulation, but also the type of practices that affect human, social, natural and financial capitals and their outputs. An inspiration economy will be a buffer that not only improves life expectancy and personal income, as per the Genuine Wealth indicators of the Anielski study, but also improve self-rated happiness and reduce youth suicide rates, since they have an intrinsic built in drive for making a difference. For inspiration to be integrated with Genuine Wealth model values, such as love, meaningful relationships, happiness, joy, freedom, sufficiency, justice and peace, they need to be sustained to be achievable. Inspiration helps fundamental principles of Genuine Wealth to be met in the future, since it is based on true intrinsic wealth that makes life worthwhile, and helps to transform our mindset from monetary or material possessions to a legacy based mindset. An inspiration economy is based on the concept that true wealth is abundant, not scarce. Inspiration is a good example of true wealth that is more abundant when it is freely given, and freely received through the spirit of reciprocity. For this true wealth, as in the case of inspiration, even though it might come as a gift from God, or we are born with its traits as many believe; we have responsibility to work, activate, maintain, or re-explore it. Inspiration, as a process if integrated with genuine wealth assessment, begins by us asking ourselves questions about ‚Äúwhat‚Äù the purpose of life is and ‚Äúhow‚Äù to achieve these purposes. These types of questions inspire us to make well-being a top priority in our life journey. This leads us to create a type of self-analysis and action plan to improve genuine wellbeing/ wealth until we reach self-satisfaction.

The self-assessment methodology of Genuine Wealth that Aneilski (2007) developed follows innovative well developed techniques and tools that inspire us to see the clarity of what is the true wealth we have. Personal Genuine Wealth Assessment involves examining ourselves in light and dark mirrors. In the light mirror, we examine what we love about ourselves and what others love about us. In the dark mirror, we look at the things we do not like about ourselves or what others dislike about us. Ultimately, these mirror images help to create a complete and honest profile of our physical, mental, emotion, and spiritual well-being.

9.12	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY AND NEUROCONOMY
The emerging science of Neuroconomics is an important development in the path towards an inspiration economy. Neuroconomics focuses on analysing the rationale of the economic decision making process in relation to human physiology. Decisions challenging socioeconomic status are associated with elevated levels of hormones. For example, a doperminic system is only activated upon achieving a reward. While on the other hand ‚Äúpain‚Äù receptors, particularly in the pre-frontal cortex of the left hemisphere of the brain show a high level of activation.¬†Serotonin¬†and¬†oxytocin¬†levels are minimised, and the general immune system shows a level of suppression. During times of socio-economic turbulence patterns associated with the reduction of levels of trust are also related to the reduction of both Serotonin and Oxytocin.

Once the brain has an elevated stimulation of pleasure circuits, this leads to a reduction in the levels of stress. In an inspiration economy we need to monitor neuroconomics optimal functioning so that we ensure that we have the most suitable immune system to create a spirit and feelings of persistence.¬† Mirror neurones¬†result in a¬†win-win¬†positive sum game¬†in which the person giving the gift receives a pleasure equivalent to the person receiving it.¬†This confirms the concept of ‚Äúgift economy‚Äù which also integrates with an inspiration economy, even though win-lose or risk avoidance lose-lose calculations differentiate both economies.

9.13	 INSPIRATION AND THE EMPATHETIC ECONOMY
Empathy can give a society, an organisation and even an individual a distinct competitive edge. To compete in an empathetic economy means we will need to implement empathetic thinking and spirit in the project or proposal design stage, negotiating stage, implementation stage, and in conflicts. The World is shifting slowly towards what we call an ‚ÄúEmpathetic Economy‚Äù. An empathetic economy is a focused economy that is designed on enhancing the returns based on the ‚Äòbig picture‚Äô and not based directly on material returns. Today, we need empathetic economy practices in order to be competitive. Today, it is no longer enough to create a product or a service that is reasonably priced and adequately functional, it must also be beautiful, unique and meaningful, imperative and most of all innovative and inspirational. Today in an empathetically based economy functionality and beauty are not enough to be inspirational, but they also have to be based on pull thinking to create a space for the potential user to react to it. Thus, proponents of design thinking expect to design the product/services with their spirit, heart and mind to be truly meaningful for today‚Äôs competitive clients, in order to stand out in a crowded marketplace. The World in the future economy of inspiration will be empathetically both wonderfully engineered and properly designed. These will be the main features for evaluating companies‚Äô goodwill. Empathy is the ability to see the World through someone else‚Äôs eyes.

An empathetic economy will be based on story-telling and creativity, and it will be difficult to teach with no formula to follow. Some people may possess empathy more naturally than others, and it is still a trait that can be developed by those willing to make an effort. For example, if government implements an empathetic economy it will need to build profound practices on how to address consumer products or services, designing for its decision makers. All products and/or services must be customised to the needs of every customer with care taken for end users. Availability of services relevant to other services in the right place and time will be one of the factors for reliability in this economy. The ease of accessibility to services and/or products in the right place and time will mean that this organisation or service provider is empathizing with the economy. An empathetic economy will enhance organisation communication issues since people will deal eye-to-eye, as empathy will enable people to consider how someone else sees the problem. The ability to see the World through the eyes of others is an economic imperative. If empathy is given the attention it deserves, companies will find new ways to please their customers, and innovators will conceive systems that save time and money. Understanding an empathy based economy requires shifting to a whole new mindset: moving from the information age to the conceptual age, left-brain linearity, analytical, and computerlike thinking are being replaced by right-brain empathy, inventiveness, and understanding what is most needed by business. Such empathetic economy practices are becoming more in demand due to the rise of the new emerging economy and developing economies. Inspiration once integrated with empathetic economy strategies will lead to a focus on designing business processes that inspire through experiences relevant to consumer needs as being innovatively caring with a variety of priced products or services. Empathy is important for analysing economic behaviour where the individual becomes the target and the utility characterised as caring and cooperative. Empathy is about making connections ‚Äòthrough competition‚Äô and not only ‚Äòthrough consumption‚Äô. Studies show that people and organisations who are good at open innovation have a higher than average business empathy. To fully understand the other organisation‚Äôs position there is a need to seek to create a mutual situation. As there is a sharp increase in service providers chasing the same opportunities, competition today will be based on the ability to see the bigger picture by collectively creating a new, efficient and large open innovation marketplace. With connectivity increasing exponentially, more empathic civilized societies are created.

9.14	 INSPIRATION AND GAMIFICATION
In an IE design thinking and¬† game-storming (including today‚Äôs gasification) are used to facilitate feedback loops, discover subconscious value drivers and validate assumptions. As a style of thinking, design thinking is generally considered the ability to combine¬†empathy¬†for the context of a problem,¬†creativity¬†in the generation of insights and solutions, and¬†rationality¬†to analyse and fit solutions to the context. If you are looking for ways to create breakthrough changes in products, customer services and the way you work, Agile Games might be the right tool¬†to change people‚Äôs work so that better products and services are offered. Gamification,¬†Gamestorming¬†and¬†Innovation games¬†are already used to improve organizational and team performance. In an inspiration based economy we can have inspirational driven games that enable societies to focus more on self-discovery, improving collaboration, reverse thinking to create breakthroughs. Gamification is found to have ultimate impact on its users since it enhances their abilities and creates new visualisation of where they want or can be. Through gamification we immerse ourselves in an indirect group scientific research and human behavioural interaction that leads us to understand the aspirations of people around the World.

The concept of gamification once it is integrated with inspiration it enables one to appreciate and visualize the needs of communities and ideas relevant to learning. Through emergent learning created by gamification a spirit of resilience of the human spirit is created. Resilience refers to an individual‚Äôs ability to adapt to stress and adversity in a world that is in constant flux on virtually every front; environmental, social, economic and personal. The cultivation of resiliency may be the greatest gift that we can give our children.

9.15	 INSPIRATION AND THE HAPPINESS ECONOMY
Over the past few years, economists have become interested in happiness or the subjective well-being economy (Frey and Stutzer, 2002). This area has long been discussed by the positive psychologists in the last two decades (Kahneman et. al, 1999). It has become clear, however, that the concept of happiness is able to offer new insights on issues if it is met with eager self-consciousness and discovery. We believe that inspiration is more abstract than just being a scientific issue that needs to be studied for the creation of a better quality of life. Inspiration represents individuals, organisations and society‚Äôs way of thinking that differentiates them from others. Graham (2011) focused on the economy of well-being using the trend where economists are increasingly using happiness surveys to study what causes populations to deliver a better satisfactory life. Today, we are witnessing many economic reports that measure happiness effects on health and marriage to the unhappiness effects of unemployment, divorce, and even commuting time. Therefore, happiness economy research can show many hidden treasures within human capability that can be discovered with the identification of the determinants of individual well-being. Happiness is seen as the currency that can serve as an alternative measure for better welfare, using techniques such as self-realisation and inspiration. Happiness can and should be measured through assessment of life satisfaction. The quality of the individuals‚Äô well-being corresponds to the level of an economy‚Äôs inspiration, as people are considered to be the best judges of the overall quality of their life. Many scientists and practitioners, including psychologists, economists, sociologists, and lifelong learning experts note that materialist issues, including money (in the form of higher income), do not buy happiness. There are figures that show people in certain poor countries are happier than many people in rich countries. Many think that this is due to people becoming accustomed to a higher income. Also, in rich countries people link their happiness to unemployment.

Easterlin (1974) was one of the earliest to establish the relationship between income and subjective well-being, including happiness (Di Tella, et. al., 2001). Even though many of the studies show that richer people are on average happier than poorer people, other studies show that income does not have much effect on happiness; other factors like health or having a job are equally or more important. New research is focusing on whether happier people simply earn more money. Using exogenous life events such as obtaining loans from banks or even winning the lottery do not really show that they lead to sustainable happiness. An improvement in low income families is found to raise happiness for some time, while for high-income people, this is not the case. One reason for the limited effect of income on happiness is that individuals evaluate their income not so much in absolute terms, but with respect to other people (relative income hypothesis). Here inspiration can play an important role. Welfare has been positively connected with economic development. The differences in income between countries are measured by purchasing power parities, in order to control for international differences in the cost of living. While in poor countries economic growth is able to raise happiness, GDP becomes less important for more developed countries. Studies by Helson (1964) and recently Frederick and Loewenstein (1999) show that even though we have become richer, without waves of inspiration in the socio-economy the overall happiness will not be affected. The more people are inspired in their aspirations over time matters. With inspiration our ability to adjust happiness with high adaptation will rise. As most economists see unemployment as an unfortunate event to be avoided as much as possible, in an inspiration economy, seeing the big picture of happiness as a life journey, we see it as a source for entrepreneurship ignition. Unless they are driven with strong intrinsic power most people are affected when they become unemployed and this affects their psychological well-being (Darity and Goldsmith,1996). Based on Britain et. al. (1994) joblessness depresses well-being more than divorce and separation. Therefore it is important to integrate inspiration practices in a happiness based economy. This should adjust many behavioural anomalies and will give more attention to the role of inspiration, self-control problems and emotions in individual decision making. Today, behavioural economics is on the way to being accepted even by mainstream economists.

9.16	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY AND FUTURE GENERATIONS
Most countries and societies are facing the most significant economic challenges in generations. From the hardships of unemployment to the perils of mounting debt, worry about the health of a national economy depends on consumerism and market success. This is besides the rising cost of life, followed by uncontrolled environmental pollution. Since the Second World War, one generation after another, has been assured that more economic growth is good for us. But if we study the best economies such as the USA for example, despite its constant growth, it still needs critical life support. Every economy to date has people losing jobs and homes and many countries such as Greece are facing complex uncertainties. Many individuals have jobs earning less than when they were young even though they have long working hours. Our time for work vs. our feeling for the quality of life is not always improving compared to previous generations.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Inspiration Economy and Future Competing Economies

The current generation has the trend to work more, enjoy less, pollute more, eat toxic foods and suffer illnesses. An inspiration economy will ask questions that make us think differently to be out of the norm, such as, why not learn new ways to work less and enjoy more? Why are we not able to learn to consume, pollute and destroy less, to give and contribute more? This is all meaningful and achievable once we set our mindset to it. To do this, we need fresh solutions from future generations that will engage in redefining goals for an inspirational based economy that we want to experience. We want a generation that discover their capacities vs. the demands of the socio-economy, rather than generations that adapt to accept supply vs. demand due to push thinking created around them. We need to create paths for the ‚ÄúKnowing‚ÄìDoing‚Äù Gap where the next generation confront the challenge of turning knowledge to selected waves of inspiration that need to be explored and attained. Once knowledge is put into action using suitable planning and analysis techniques it can inspire deeds. This learning by doing can eliminate fear, abolish destructive internal competition and make the next generation focus on what matters.

9.17	 INSPIRATION ECONOMY AND HOLISTIC THINKING
An inspiration economy depends on holistic and critical thinking to habitually impose criteria and intellectual standards upon thinking, taking charge of the construction of thinking. Causal loops help in creating inspirational maps used in systems thinking to describe operational, functional, temporal and other relationships. System dynamics are also important for inspirational economy exploration that depends in the end on the processes made of activities and functions. With holistic thinking, system dynamics and an inspirational spirit as functional and operational behaviour can be analysed over time. Using holistic thinking as a way of life can be interpreted as continuous application to view the issue, situation or problem. This should help people to see the missing connections where others do not and to develop an understanding of a situation while identifying the real problem. Holistic thinking is used for inspiration economy practices to resolve problems that need innovative approaches, predict probable futures, risks and their mitigation.

9.18	 INSPIRATION AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
Economic reality is evolving, as we speak, and the laws of competitiveness are not just changing fast, they are changing dramatically. Growth cannot be achieved by means of being efficient in the production process, but in the optimisation of both human and knowledge capital. Economic development means more than just having practices that are in an innovationdriven economy. In such sophisticated dynamic economies; the integration of products and services creates a new wave of inspiration. Although businesses are becoming more aware of the importance of innovation, inspiration is yet to be known for its role in economic dynamics. Economics for the Greeks meant the wise management of the dynamics of the household. Inspiration helped control the real source of dynamics of the household for the conditions of a well-being spirit and values. The dynamics of economies affect the ‚Äòquality of life‚Äô and ‚Äòhappiness‚Äô, so if inspiration economies focus on both these issues they can make a positive contribution to the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual essence of economic dynamics. In this handbook we believe that all the following economies play a role in leading and developed countries, taking into account that there is proper utilization and optimization of the knowledge economy, as shown in Figure (9-1): Inspiration Economy, Green Economy, Purple Economy, Ecosystem Economy, Innovation Economy, Learning Economy and Social Economy.

9.19	 INSPIRATION PROGRAMME INITIATIVES
In order to shift to an inspiration economy, one has to realise that this will not happen by just need, inspiration economy approaches need to be built in international programmes that have a major influence on humanity. A recent success story of inspirational power was the Traditional Olympic Games which enriched the lives of 12 million children of all abilities in schools and communities in 20 countries (21 including the UK) through the power of high-quality and inclusive physical education, sport and play. The inspirational based approaches that were prepared since 2007 by the key partners in this International Inspiration programme including UK Sport, the British Council and UNICEF, established a widespread international sport development programme that benefited young people in the UK and across the World. The traditional games resources have been developed specifically to recognise each country‚Äôs participation in the International Inspiration programme. The inspiration approaches developed in this programme influenced 20 overseas countries, using physical education and sport to create and share innovative, high-quality practice that has developed learning in many areas and improved the lives of millions of young people all over the World.

Each country has selected a game that they feel best represents the inspiration of their culture and traditions. These 21 games are showcased in this resource for young people to play while having fun and learning more about each country‚Äôs culture and traditions through PE, sport and play. The uniqueness of the intensity of inspiration in this international programme raised the ability to create a connection between the three key learning and development platforms for young people: education, sport and community. The inspiration of the traditional games was found to support the ongoing learning and development of the participants and thus enhance their opportunity for being inspired again. The programme‚Äôs influence and inspiration on education was that it became a resource that can be used to help teachers (supported by young sport leaders) to: plan, prepare and deliver high-quality curriculum PE lessons and sport sessions; and develop intra-school programmes and after-school activities. While sport was inspired by this Olympic programme by enhancing the resources used by sport coaches (supported by young leaders) to: plan, prepare and deliver high-quality sports sessions (warm-ups, skills developments, games activities and cool downs). These practices bridged the gap between PE and sport in schools and communities. Every country‚Äôs community that participated in these traditional games competitions used this programme as an inspiration resource used by the community leaders and instructors while being supported by young sport leaders. Such programs help to create a more self-dependent culture that can plan, prepare and deliver activities that bring people closer together. This creates inspiration and better communication mediums between children, youths, adults, and parents to build healthy communities that lead to happier, healthier and productive lives.

9.20	 CAPITALISING ON INSPIRATION

Let us illustrate this by taking the example of the Sport Club Recife. Recife is a sport club known for having some of the most passionate fans in Brazil. They are fans from ‚Äòbirth to death‚Äô. Capitalising on their inspiration with the club, the club management wanted to develop their passion further, as no other football team has done before. While most football team‚Äôs communications have a commercial drive inviting fans to buy more merchandising and tickets, their challenge was to engage the fans in deeper values that represent their determination of being different fans. The Recife Management put a strategy to these types of fans‚Äô passion to the good. Recife initiated the idea of having a donation consent programme for hearts, eyes and lungs after their death, as if they could keep cheering for the Sport Club Recife even after death. Many Recife fans were a source of further inspiration by offering to donate their body as a way to show their passion for their team. The idea was to use the fans‚Äô passion to inspire the sport community to promote a bigger social cause while also generating a much more passionate conversation around the team‚Äôs brand. The outcome was an incredible engagement response, reducing dramatically the organ donation waiting lists, and in some categories reducing these to zero. Capitalisation on inspiration was a good public relations campaign, which lead to the engagement of the media. The case of Recife reminds us how many lost opportunities we have due to not capitalizing on inspiration in the right time and place. ‚ÄúEven a journey of 1,000 miles must begin with one step‚Äù Lao Tse.

9.21	 FUTURE OF THE INSPIRATION ECONOMY
Adam Smith‚Äôs assumptions about production and distribution technologies were essential for the ‚Äòinvisible hand‚Äô to work. Today, these assumptions are increasingly unsuitable, due to the current turbulent economic situation and rise of human rights together with the realisation of human potential. Many researchers from different disciplines believe that the frontiers of the next economy will not depend on commerce, but on human capabilities and the ability to discover and apply potential. The next economy will raise competition based on its ability to raise questions. At this point we can organize our concerns in a coherent and comprehensive framework. Through looking at the behaviour of people today, we can immerse ourselves and our sprits in concrete reality, to determine the future economy in the next three decades. The goal is to bring ‚Äúcreative imagination and trained intelligence to the solution of social problems‚Äù ‚Äì and to problems in the workplace. To achieve this goal, we need to foster integrative, problem-centred learning across disciplines.

A positive and clear future prediction is that the inspiration economy will continue with different types of related jobs. Trends for these jobs are already growing, especially for titles such as ‚ÄúChief Inspiration Officer‚Äù (CIO). The CIO role will inspire the organization and its human capital to know what they ‚Äòcould do‚Äô and ‚Äòcould be‚Äô through re-discovering or re-vitalising their potential. Through the CIO organisations are expected to calculate the year‚Äôs yield based on the ‚Äòamount of inspiration‚Äô (both intensity and frequency) for employees, customers, and investors. CIOs will enhance the organization‚Äôs power to inspire anyone, anytime, anywhere through spreading learning and practices of the language of inspiration. In such organisations CIOs‚Äô outcomes will be measured on how much they have managed to positively influence people in their professional life or towards a better overall contribution to life. The need for better inspiration in the future means more titles such as ‚ÄòInspiration Driving Manager‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspiration Economy Architect‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspiration Engineer‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspiration Resources Manager‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspiration Expert‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspiration Economy Consultant‚Äô and ‚ÄòInspiration Value Consultant‚Äô. These people working in an inspiration business will have extraordinary communication skills. Furthermore, a future ‚Äòinspiration specialist‚Äô will place strong emphasis on the way messages in organizations are crafted and delivered. The main responsibility of such a specialist is to keep everyone energized and enthusiastic.

There is also a need for new terms already covered in different areas of this handbook and these will be expected to be used and spread in the culture of an inspiration economy. The most important terms that can be mentioned here are ‚ÄòInspiration-Asset‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspirational-Capture‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspirational-Transfer‚Äô and ‚ÄòInspirational Optimiser‚Äô. In an inspiration economy, we would gauge ourselves, organisations and societies by the level of inspiration asset intensity. Our ability to capture inspiration or transfer it to others will be another source of differentiation. Finally, since inspiration will always constrain our ability to optimise within constraints, limited conditions and resources will be considered another competitive advantage. The future is more promising for an inspiration economy in countries who use digital technology as an opportunity in classrooms. In such inspiration based education, more time will be given for collaboration between students and cross-disciplinary projects. In the future there will be more practices that spread disruptive education based on the spirit of investigation and discovery in research. There will be more opportunities for community-based learning in all types of organisations, where Total People Engagement (TPE) will be expected by most of society.

FINAL NOTE
As agreed exploring a human based economy is not an easy ride. While there are still many questions left unanswered about the concept of inspiration economy and many possible practices and principles to be drawn, this handbook have aimed to establish the beneficial role and importance of adopting such economy practices. Moreover, this handbook have reviewed all the theories of relevance to inspirational based economy to help us understand and imagine the different expected future of socio-economy that different scholars are searching for. The handbook started with a question about what is Inspiration Economy? And then concluded with even more challenging question of what is the future of Inspiration Economy? This should help the readers, the researchers and those enthusiasts for new concepts that drive our world away from materialistic economy feel comfortable to the big picture of what all this ‚ÄúInspiration Economy‚Äù is all about. Even though not explicitly mention this handbook call for a radical change in our way of thinking in order to build up a better life journey story that would shape also new possibilities for the man-kind in the long run.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Final Note

In chapter one the question why have a handbook on an inspiration based economy is posed. In answer to this it is noted that self-worth, the feeling of being totally independent and having a highly competitive contribution to the World does not always come from materialistic economic theory, however it can come from a self-driven and value based economy. This simple combination economy is an ‚ÄúInspiration Economy‚Äù. There is a niche for an economy that is based on re-vitalising the self through inspiration. The World is in need of an economy that enables natural resources and energy trapped within the human inner self to be realised. This handbook relates collections on milestones for finding different purposes and means for an ‚Äòinspiration based economy‚Äô, regardless of capabilities or development at this stage, and the stage when starting the journey of inspiration. This calls for contributions towards an inspiration based economy for everyone to participate in. This handbook is considered to be important since it addresses the issue of influencing change without power and even with limited resources. It is significant since it gives the power to influence without having power of position, money, fame, forces or followers, and calls for the practical shift of power to inspiring governments and non-profit organisations, or even towards the new trend of ‚Äòfor-giving‚Äô organisations, where inspiration can be created and maintained in a circular economy. We hope that the reader of this handbook became more convinced that there are tools for overcoming many problems whether family, society, country and regional or globally based, by the power of inspiration. We tried to show a more structured and scientific based inspiration about facing life challenges, overcoming fears of failures and learning from them. Finally, the handbook is about a holistic view created by both our right and left sides of the brain, where positive psychology works in harmony with socio-economic needs and where humanities and sciences meet each other to develop a better World now and for future generations. The demands for an inspiration economy as we have tried to show in this journey is going to increase. It is related that inspiration driven activities and services are used more today to raise a communities capacity for meeting society demands. Through inspiration, societies can experience new products and services that improve the quality of life. However, society‚Äôs dynamic demands require new economic enablers that enhance for instance social inclusion and labour market integration. We shed a light that European Union is more aware about inspiration economy practices that other countries. The European Commission (2011) report shows an emphasis on the need for new economic resources that address the rising demands of human welfare needs, be it health care, education, resource efficiency and environmental challenges. Thus, we believe more that through inspiration, such societies and humans needs can be addressed if we are more equipped to solve social, economic, political, technological and environmental problems.

Final Note

Inspiration therefore, if well managed, raises the capacity of society to meet its demands through raising its ability to identify new opportunities and also its ability to learn. Inspiration raises the ability of individuals and communities to observe, absorb and reflect on all possible market needs, involving seen and hidden competencies. Having Inspiration embedded within our societies diverse approaches is even more appreciated by OECD starting from (OECD Forum on Social Innovation, 2000). As discussed Inspiration Economy starts when we in principle is considered to be about discovering your leap through dismantling the foundation of the problem (Hendrick, 2009). Inspiration establishes our ability to spot the upper limit of the human being, thus it is about thriving in sustained abundance, love and creativity. It is a value that affects us and most of all influences us. The inspiration state was found to be characterized by feelings of connection, openness, clarity, and energy (Hart, 1998). The actions or power that inspiration creates towards moving intellect or emotions by making people put their thoughts into action is unique and very difficult to imitate. Without a belief in inspiration it might not be possible to even think to change course in life when people are unhappy about its outcomes. Inspiration makes people take extra risks in life to pursue dreams and persist towards achieving them, even if there is failure time after time. In synthesis of Thrash, et. al. (2010) work, inspiration economy is needed more than ever today to support the production of creative work, whereas effort supports the production of technical merit. Through inspiration it is possible to understand what the good life is. Social relationships, work and income, health and societal benefits; are all affected by inspiration. Inspired people are more likely to have self-confidence and the ability to optimize constraints, with a variety of approaches to learning. Inspiration is very important for social relationships, appropriate adaptation, society, culture positive thinking styles and most of all a high contribution. Once people are inspired they focus on ‚Äòwhat is right‚Äô rather than ‚Äòwho is right‚Äô and define their mission and work on pursuing it. With inspiration people work towards dignity and are committed towards more powerful contributions. One could say that the word inspiration is highly linked with a unique sustained intrinsic energy that influences the behaviour or even transforms it to a new level (Elliot, 1997). In Buheji et. al. (2014) we have seen inspiration as a form of human persistence to achieve, change, transform or model a visualised goal that would create a wave for a new economy.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Final Note

In this handbook also we share our realisation about the importance of the relations between the economy and psychology is considered. It is noted that economics, as a social subject, has not always been so distant from psychology and economists like Smith, Bentham, Edgeworth and Marshall were aware of the importance of the psychological foundations in their concepts and beliefs. These well-known psychologists even acknowledged the importance of these two determinants of human behaviour. Frey and Benz, of the University of Zurich, carried out research on modern economics and psychology to establish the level of continuity of this relationship and found that it still swings towards supporting human co-existence and selective interaction, which are practices appreciated today more than ever. Psychological considerations in economics were lost in the last two centuries. However, with the spread of positive psychology and good best practices today, new important insights for psychology and other social sciences are leading to the fast development of a new field of ‚Äòbehavioural economics‚Äù. It is a concept that supports the hypothesis that behaviour can systematically deviate from a fully rational model of decision making and from the current economic approaches resulting from bounded self-interest. Actually, as per ‚Äòbehavioural economics‚Äô individuals are found to behave in a non-selfish way in many situations. Modern economics still carries behavioural models which disregard human psychological factors. Therefore, today there is a rise in, and demand for, what is called ‚Äúhomo oeconomicus‚Äù, which leads humans to take decisions based on rational and emotionless behaviour based on cost effectiveness and not based on the level of inspiration. Without positive emotions and feelings in the decision making process we are consuming higher degrees of rationality that are limited by self-control problems, and solely based on actions guided by self-interest and non-resilience. In reality today, as per the law of supply and demand, when the relative price or the opportunity cost of an activity increases, the demand for the respective good will fall, and the respective activity will be carried out less. This economic approach to materialist controlled human behaviour has been successfully applied to almost every society, every sector and every process which are today together called ‚Äúeconomic imperialism‚Äù. This economic approach has been linked to other supplemental concepts such as the ‚ÄúLaw of Economics‚Äù, or ‚ÄúFamily Economics‚Äù; however they seem to be far from being really well-balanced. Inspiration economy enablers discussed in this book are important in the evolution of this path its sound framework and strategy that will manifest vision, and demonstrate a model that will be a source for passion, while travelling the path. For societies to travel along the path of inspiration they need the proper environment to innovate with results in order to grow in today‚Äôs world and stay competitive with high-quality products and services, and they need to commit totally to innovation.

Inspiration generators demolish our fears of failure and create a new source of learning as we have learned together in parts of this handbook. When we cannot sleep, and are trying to find the ‚ÄòAha moment‚Äô we are enhancing our inspiration generators. Inspiration can evolve faster once there is an innovation-driven economy, the blend of innovative ideas and the spirit of inspiration become the most important raw materials for a new inspiration economy driven business. Evolving towards an inspiration economy means evolution towards a stronger ability to generate ideas. Through such inspiration practices our lives hopefully will become a memory that will stay for a long time which we called here legacy. Today there are many sources to enhance inspiration evolution. For example, through social media and the web, crowd funding is just one example that is becoming an effective e-source of inspiration evolution. Sources of inspiration are important and without a prepared background inspiration will not take place. Inspiration requires producing new cultural and artistic expressions, while others are experiencing culture and the arts by attending musical or dramatic events or by reading fiction, poetry or other forms of creative writing. This is the differentiation of the level and intensity of inspiration.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Final Note

Inspiration economy needs us to optimise and overcome the control of ‚Äúconvergent thinking‚Äù, even though this thinking dominates most of the areas of our available brain information. This means that we need to overcome the fixed paradigm and knowledge about how things should be done. Through overcoming convergent thinking the awareness journey can be reached, thus we‚Äôll start knowing and realising where things are and only then can inspiration occur. Inspiration requires that we discover something that might be not accepted by convergent thinking, or seen as totally wrong or not relevant. If we manage to introduce divergent thinking across borders within our minds, then we start to be more and more an inspiration spirit. Inspiration comes most of the time not through long thinking, but radical reverse thinking. Evidence suggests that inspiration can come, for example, from the exhibition of arts, photography or sculpture. This type of inspiration can support creating long and reverse thinking which is much more than deep thinking, it is a source of inspiration creativity. With long and/or reverse thinking it is possible to read and contribute to knowledge or the socio-economy with high quality of production, i.e. a competitive outcome. For example, an inspiration might occur with long and/or reverse thinking, when reading, or with situations of high enjoyment such as writing poetry, seeing a well painted picture, meditating with nature, or even listening to well-read scripts full of wisdom, relaxing with specific music, or witnessing a scientific discovery that will change the face of humanity for ever. These moments and types of enjoyment can lead to reflection on specific areas of accumulated knowledge that tickle minds and cause inspiration. The association of feelings and ideas that come from a long thinking journey with a new wave of thinking is what makes inspirational thoughts and ideation, besides being a strong source for the economy. Thus the more the gap for innovations is bridged the more the whole game in the context of socio-economy can be played differently. This type of process helps humans go beyond the normal cycle of innovation, or even development, to areas never dared to be thought about. It is a feeling, mindset and spirit, when combined leads people to start restoring their capabilities, thus giving belief in the ability to discover and change to the betterment of people and society. It is simply an awakening of hidden potential and strengths. It is in this area where we see ourselves to be more open minded and affluent with alternatives around us. In inspiration based economy we‚Äôll discover lots of areas where it is appreciated that inspiration is about finding answers to what is being looked for and it is also the secret power of people‚Äôs daring to select only one of these answers. We can examine the characteristics and measures in a better way to determine whether an economy promotes greatest good or happiness for people. The approaches of inspiration economy would be dedicated to measuring the maturity and level of inspiration economy needs to focus on how economic policies enhance the pursuit of happiness in comparison to the current gross domestic product (GDP).

Final Note

Currently maturity of any economy is measured by GDP that counts remedial and defensive expenditures for pollution, accidents, war, crime and sickness as positives, rather than deducting these costs. However, in an inspiration based economy we also need to measure the value of contributions such as natural resources and ecosystem services, improvement in quality of life, unpaid domestic work, volunteer work, good health and social connections. Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), could be used to more accurately measure economic progress in an inspiration economy. With chapter eight the outcomes of an inspiring economy are considered. It can be reiterated that inspiration is not only a fuelling source for an economy, but also a source for individual well-being and quality of life, through establishing benefits to individuals and the community. These include firstly the setting of a clear life purpose. Thrash et. al. (2010) contend that purpose in life and gratitude should mediate the association between inspiration and wellbeing. Secondly, there is awareness of unrecognised opportunities. Inspiration implies an awareness of unrecognized opportunities; individuals feel they can transcend the self, which is integral to a purpose in life. Similarly, the motivation to promulgate, or actualize this awareness implies that insight is intrinsically important and valuable. Thirdly, inspiration comes more with gratitude where individuals feel they receive a gift. Once a gain is experienced, or a benefit that can be attributed to someone else there is inspiration. Inspiration implies that individuals become aware and start to realise desirable opportunities around them and this is associated with their wellbeing (Adler et. al., 2005). Through the work of Thrash and Elliot (2004) we learned how to distinguish between two main processes in inspiration, and these are ‚Äòinspired by‚Äô and ‚Äòinspired to‚Äô. The first process where there is ‚Äòinspired by‚Äô and a feeling of appreciation and recognition of opportunity, possibility, insight, awareness, and understanding. The second process is ‚Äòinspired to‚Äô where there is the urge to extend, disseminate, utilize, and promulgate this opportunity. These two processes complete each other and lead to a dynamical circulation that affects life contributions and socio-economies.

Final Note

Finally, this handbook gives a great consideration for future of Inspiration Economy and the future competing economies. It is noted that many researchers from different disciplines believe that the frontiers of the next economy will not depend on commerce, but on human capabilities and the ability to discover and apply potential. The next economy will increase competition based on its ability to raise questions. At this point we can organize our concerns in a coherent and comprehensive framework that integrate all the efforts of similar economies that calls of discovery of the essence of things. The goal is to bring ‚Äúcreative imagination and trained intelligence to the solution of social problems‚Äù ‚Äì and to problems in the workplace, in the societies and even to the level of nations. To achieve this goal, there is a need to foster integrative, problem-centred learning across disciplines which inspiration can play the common thread to. A positive and clear future prediction is that with such an inspiration economy we will continue to discover more things that around us, but missed due to the materialistic thinking that dominated the world for some time now.

HANDBOOK OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY

Final Note

In this handbook we introduced many job titles, new concepts and terms that an inspiration based economy would need to sustain its influence. Terms as ‚ÄòInspiration-Asset‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspirationalCapture‚Äô, ‚ÄòInspirational-Transfer‚Äô and ‚ÄòInspirational Optimiser‚Äô would be normal inside such an economy. In an inspiration economy, we would gauge ourselves, organisations and societies by the level of inspiration asset intensity. Our ability to capture inspiration or transfer it to others will be another source of differentiation. Finally, since inspiration will always constrain our ability to optimise within constraints, limited conditions and resources will be considered, if managed well, another competitive advantage and not dis-advantage. Many things are awaiting us ahead with Inspiration Economy, we just need to open the doors of opportunities and the well to try.

INTRODUCTION TO INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY
The development and complications of the world economy and its increasing instability lead many researchers, scientists, field development experts, society activists and those with the ability to see the big picture of the purpose of life, from all over the world, to call for a new economy that is independent from the materialistic resources. All these leading thinkers called for such an economy that would consider the powers of human being intrinsic capabilities, the need for of a balanced social, environmental, quality of life approaches and positive psychology to create better human based economy. Even though a better quality of life based economy were visualized earlier with the advent of Knowledge Economy (KE) as early as the 60‚Äôs of the last century, no real progress to date can be claimed to the establishment of civilized movement for a better world that is based on co-existence and fair competition. In reality, the speedy transformation to what looks like KE created harm in certain cases where societies became in more conflicts and fear, while on the individual level it created more stress and resistance to change (Urama and Acheampong, 2013). However, with the spread of KE society practices and the new disruptive technology managed to bring, we started to see more innovation, entrepreneurship and increasingly even learning practices that give people the chance to discover many hidden powers within oneself. This lead to the establishment of new concepts as Learning Economy, Innovation Economy and Entrepreneurship Economy. However, these noble concepts where demolished by the power of Capital based Economy that used only part of KE practices to stay alive as the strongest economy that manipulated human thinking and paradigm, where most societies and governments found it easy to digest and understand.

THE BORN OF (INSPIRATION ECONOMY)
In 2012 and 2013 a field expert and academic called Mohamed Buheji, started a series of field models and testing in the government organization in Kingdom of Bahrain after small laboratories carried out also in different organisations around Arabian Gulf Countries since 2008. These Labs were focused on the Lean thinking, competitiveness, innovation and enhancement of applied learning. However, the consistent failures and challenges of such labs in co-dependent societies lead Dr Buheji to develop a unique concept called ‚ÄúInspiration Labs¬©‚Äù.

The concept of ‚ÄòInspiration Labs¬©‚Äô had delivered very successful models that would lead to major and radical change outcomes in the society. Inspiration Labs were carried in cooperating organization as Schools, Health Centres, Hospitals, Government Planning Centres, Electricity and Water Authority, Labor and Human Capital Authorities, etc. Based on the success of Inspiration Labs, Dr Buheji supported with scientists, academics and world leading practitioners founded the first peer reviewed international journal in relevance to Inspiration Economy called Journal of Inspiration Economy in March 2013, with more than 48 members as in the editorial board and research reviewers, coming from 18 nationalities and representing leading universities and research centres, from India, New Zealand and Australia in the east to Canada and Brazil in the west.

WHAT IS INSPIRATION ECONOMY FOR IIIE?
IIIE defines inspiration economy as an economy that focuses on raising the capacity of discovering the potential of human beings abilities to be the currency of competition and source of a planned outcome and legacy. Thus Inspiration Economy (IE) is a mix of many disciplines that lead to inspiration practices that motivate the spirit to a level that creates waves of inspiration in socio-economic development. These mixed discipline practices can be like entrepreneurship, innovation, risk taking, opportunity seeking/creating; along with a focused and change driven mindset. It is a type of economy that would be based on our societies and organisations‚Äô abilities to discover the potential and the capacities or human being and thus capitalize on it through inspiration (Buheji and Brychan, 2015). Dr Buheji in both his coming ‚Äúunder print‚Äù books (Handbook of Inspiration Economy) and (Inspiring Governments), besides in his published Arabic book (In search of the inspired) mentioned that such an inspiration can be easily created to reduce the gap between the different world societies and thus would help to establish a more stable yet still dynamic socio-economies. Inspiration once created can lead to a persistent human being that sees the big picture of his/her role in the life journey, thus can change both societies and countries fate. Once the inspired develops the ability of a Lifelong learner characteristics, as per Dr Buheji (2014 and 2015) paper publications, we can see a different type of communities that are full of potentials and opportunities that would enhance the level of human creativity.

ESTABLISHMENT OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INSPIRATION ECONOMY
Based on the successes that Journal of Inspiration Economy achieved from the world body of knowledge and practitioners community, Dr. Mohamed Buheji (from Bahrain) and his colleague Dr. Majda Naji (from Slovenia) founded the International Institute of Inspiration Economy (IIIE) as a Non-Profit Organisation in Europe in 14th of August 2015. IIIE have been established in a country considered to be in the middle of the world, that is Slovenia and in a city called Maribor and is dedicated to serve not only as research institute, but also as a centre for projects, training and publication developments in the areas relevant to Inspiration, Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Knowledge, Learning, Co-existence that would have its impact on the targeted socio-economies. For more information on IIIE, please visit: http://inspirationeconomy.org/

SAMPLE OF AN ‚ÄúINSPIRATION LABS¬©‚Äù INTRODUCTORY WORKSHOP
What is Inspiration Labs¬© Inspiration Labs¬© was developed by one of the Institute of Inspirational Economy founders Dr Mohamed Buheji to help unleash the human abilities to reinvent the rules of the business and create a radical sustainable change. The labs create connection between employee engagement and financial and non-financial Outcomes (i.e. beyond results only). The outcome(s) of the Inspiration Labs¬© create a feel of a new reality about the human ability to deliver simple solutions for complex problems, that would raise the capacity compared to the rising demand (with high availability), with minimal resources, based on the concepts of ‚ÄúInfluencing without Power‚Äù. Labs Objectives Creating Inspiration driven Economy Models through Total People Engagement that shows how certain mindset, processes, techniques and practices can lead to huge impact on the community outcomes and thus the socio-economy status. The Lab usually runs on a 5 focused days, with minimum of 3 days, and it is based on the conepts of lifelong learning and learning by doing where more the members of the labs are divided in three or more teams to create ‚Äúinspirational results‚Äù compared to time and resources through the following: ‚òê	 Explore the types of opportunities in the specific setting of the organization or the community targeted. ‚òê	 Enhance the possibility of discovering the uncovered, based on the services trends and the linking the data based on ‚Äúreverse thinking‚Äù. ‚òê	 Giving the delegates the ability to evaluate the type of inspiration they can do individually or collectively.

‚òê	 Measuring and improving the model is done during and after the Lab, however the lab is not officially closed till results are seen for the selected models. ‚òê	 Once the model is successful the leaders of the specific community or organisation are asked to generalise the model to create a major impact. Definition ‚Äì Inspirational economy model means there are outcomes or secret formula revealed through lab, that can or would create a change in a specific setting, community, country status or statistics and in the same time would change those involved to believe about their hidden powers and in their ability to influence others with external powers. Labs Outline: The labs makes extensive use of attendee participation and discussion to reinforce the concepts of inspiration, entrepreneurship and reverse thinking. Each lab embodies the following salient aspects: Day-1 ‚Äì Model(s) Definition Stage ‚òê	 What are the Requirements and capacity to change ‚òê	 What is mindset that would have the proper Attitudes to criticism ‚òê	 Fundamental requirements for Degree of openness to new ideas ‚òê	 Structuring vs. Disruptive approaches Attitudes to conflict ‚òê	 Development of Degree of willingness to discuss sensitive issues openly ‚òê	 Degree to which the society structure facilitates change ‚òê	 Attitudes to experimentation in processes and products ‚òê	 Ensure readiness for Repetition, Failures, Appreciation and Challenges during the process for discovery, as per figure (1).
