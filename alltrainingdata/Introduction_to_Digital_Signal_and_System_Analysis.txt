Introduction to Digital Signal and System Analysis

Preface

Preface
Since the 1990s, digital signals have been increasingly used not only in various industries and engineering equipments but also in everybody’s daily necessities. Mobile phones, TV receivers, music CDs, multimedia computing, etc, are the indispensable items in modern life, in which digital formats are taken as a basic form for carrying and storing information. The major reason for the advancement in the use of digital signals is the big leap forward in the popularization of microelectronics and computing technology in the past three decades. Traditional analogue broadcast is being widely upgraded to digital. A general shift from analogue to digital systems has taken place and achieved unequivocal benefits in signal quality, transmission efficiency and storage integrity. In addition, data management advantage in digital systems has provided users with a very friendly interface. A typical example is the popular pull-down manual, easy to find, make choices and more choices are made available. As marching into the digital era, many people in different sectors are quite keen to understand why this has happened and what might be the next in this area. They hope to obtain basic principles about digital signals and associated digital systems. Instead of targeting advanced or expert level, they as beginners often hope to grasp the subject as efficient and effective as possible without undertaking impossible task under usually limited time and effort available. This book is written for those beginners who want to gain an overview of the topic, understand the basic methods and know how to deal with basic digital signals and digital systems. No matter the incentive is from curiosity, interest or urgently acquiring needed knowledge for one’s profession, this book is well suited. The output standards are equivalent to university year two which lays a good foundation for further studies or moving on to specialised topics, such as digital filters, digital communications, discrete time-frequency representation, and time-scale analysis. The required mathematics for the reader is basically at pre-university level, actually only junior high schools maths is mainly involved. The content of materials in this book has been delivered to second year engineering and IT students at university for more than 10 years. A feature in this book is that the digital signal or system is mainly treated as originally existing in digital form rather than always regarded as an approximation version of a corresponding analogue system which gives a wrong impression that digital signal is poor in accuracy, although many digital signals come from taking samples out of analogue signals. The digital signal and system stand as their own and no need to use the analogue counter part to explain how they work. To help understanding and gaining good familiarity to the topic, it will be very helpful to do some exercises attached to each chapter, which are selected from many and rather minimal in term of work load.

Digital Signals and Sampling

1	 Digital Signals and Sampling
1.1	Introduction
Digital signal processing (DSP) has become a common tool for many disciplines. The topic includes the methods of dealing with digital signals and digital systems. The techniques are useful for all the branches of natural and social sciences which involve data acquisition, analysis and management, such as engineering, physics, chemistry, meteorology, information systems, financial and social services. Before the digital era, signal processing devices were dominated by analogue type. The major reason for DSP advancement and shift from analogue is the extraordinary growth and popularization of digital microelectronics and computing technology. The reason that digital becomes a trend to replace analogue systems, apart from it is a format that microprocessors can be easily used to carry out functions, high quality data storage, transmission and sophisticated data management are the other advantages. In addition, only 0s and 1s are used to represent a digital signal, noise can easily be suppressed or removed. The quality of reproduction is high and independent of the medium used or the number of reproduction. Digital images are two dimensional digital signals, which represent another wide application of digital signals. Digital machine vision, photographing and videoing are already widely used in various areas. In the field of signal processing, a signal is defined as a quantity which carries information. An analogue signal is a signal represented by a continuous varying quantity. A digital signal is a signal represented by a sequence of discrete values of a quantity. The digital signal is the only form for which the modern microprocessor can take and exercise its powerful functions. Examples of digital signals which are in common use include digital sound and imaging, digital television, digital communications, audio and video devices. To process a signal is to make numerical manipulation for signal samples. The objective of processing a signal can be to detect the trend, to extract a wanted signal from a mixture of various signal components including unwanted noise, to look at the patterns present in a signal for understanding underlying physical processes in the real world. To analyse a digital system is to find out the relationship between input and output, or to design a processor with pre-defined functions, such as filtering and amplifying under applied certain frequency range requirements. A digital signal or a digital system can be analysed in time domain, frequency domain or complex domain, etc.

Signal representation and processing

Representation of digital signals can be specific or generic. A digital signal is refereed to a series of numerical numbers,

…, 2, 4, 6, 8, … where 2, 4, 6 are samples and the whole set of samples is called a signal. In a generic form, a digital signal can be represented as time-equally spaced data

Digital Signals and Sampling

..., x[−1] , x[0] , x[1] , x[2] , ...
where -1, 0, 1, 2 etc are the sample numbers, x[0], x[1], x[2], etc are samples. The square brackets represent the digital form. The signal can be represented as a compact form

x[n]

−∞ < n < ∞

	

(1.1)

In the signal, x[-1], x[1], x[100], etc, are the samples, defined at the sample number variable

n is the sample number. The values of a digital signal are only being

n , which indicates the occurrence order of samples and may be given a specific

unit of time, such as second, hour, year or even century, in specific applications. We can have many digital signal examples: -- Midday temperature at Brighton city, measured on successive days, -- Daily share price, -- Monthly cost in telephone bills, -- Student number enrolled on a course, -- Numbers of vehicles passing a bridge, etc. Examples of digital signal processing can be given in the following: Example 1.1 To obtain a past 7 day’s average temperature sequence. The averaged temperature sequence for past 7 days is

y[n] =

1 (x[n] + x[n − 1] + x[n − 2]... + x[n − 6]) . 7

For example, if n=0 represents today, the past 7 days average is

y[0] =

1 (x[0] + x[−1] + x[−2]... + x[−6]) 7

where x[0], x[−1], x[−2], ... represent the temperatures of today, yesterday, the day before yesterday, …; y[0] represents the average of past 7 days temperature from today and including today. On the other hand,

y[1] =

1 (x[1] + x[0] + x[−1] + ... + x[−5]) 7

represents the average of past 7 days temperature observed from tomorrow and including tomorrow, and so on. In a shorter form, the new sequence of averaged temperature can be written as

y[n] =

1 7 ∑ x[n − k + 1] 7 k =1

where x[n] is the temperature sequence signal and y[n] is the new averaged temperature sequence. The purpose of average can be used to indicate the trend. The averaging acts as a low-pass filter, in which fast fluctuations have been removed as a result. Therefore, the sequence y[n] will be smoother than x[n]. Example 1.2. To obtain the past M day simple moving averages of share prices, let x[n] denotes the close price, y M [n] the averaged close price over past M days.

y M [ n] =

y M [ n] =

∑ x[n − k + 1]
k =1

(1.2)

For example, M=20 day simple moving average is used to indicate 20 day trend of a share price. M=5, 120, 250 (trading days) are usually used for indicating 1 week, half year and one year trends, respectively. Figure 1.1 shows a share’s prices with moving averages of different trading days.

Analogue-to-digital conversion

Although some signals are originally digital, such as population data, number of vehicles and share prices, many practical signals start off in analogue form. They are continuous signals, such as human’s blood pressure, temperature and heart pulses. A continuous signal can be first converted to a proportional voltage waveform by a suitable transducer, i.e. the analogue signal is generated. Then, for adapting digital processor, the signal has to be converted into digital form by taking samples. Those samples are usually equally spaced in time for easy processing and interpretation. Figure 1.2 shows a analogue signal and its digital signal by sampling with equal time intervals. The upper is the analogue signal x(t) and the lower is the digital signal sampled at time t = nT, where n is the sample number and T is the sampling interval. Therefore,

x[n] = x(nT )

Sampling theorem

For ease of storage or digital processing, an analogue signal must be sampled into a digital signal. The continuous signal is being taken sample at equal time interval and represented by a set of members. First of all, a major question about it is how often should an analogue signal be sampled, or how frequent the sampling can be enough to represent the details of the original signal. It is obvious that too often will cause redundancy which will reduce the processing efficiency and cause an unnecessarily large size of data storage, but too sparse will cause a loss of signal details.

Introduction to Digital Signal and System Analysis -- Shannon’s sampling theorem

Digital Signals and Sampling

Claude E. Shannon 1916-1949) established the sampling theorem that an analogue signal containing components up to maximum frequency 2

fc

fc

Hz may be completely represented by samples, provided that the sampling rate

fs

is at least

(i.e. at least 2 samples are to present per period). That is

fs ≥ 2 fc

(1.3)

Let the sampling interval T =

T≤

1  2 fc

1 , the sampling requirement is equivalently represented as fs
(1.4)

Given sampling frequency

f s , the maximum analogue frequency allowed in the signal is
 (1.5)

fc =

1 1 fs = 2 2T

Under sampling will cause aliasing. That is, details of original signal will be lost and high frequency waveforms may be mistakenly represented as low frequency ones by the sampled digital signal. See Figure 1.3. It is worth noting that use of minimum sampling frequency is not absolutely safe, as those samples may just been placed at all zeros-crossing points of the waveform.

Digital Signals and Sampling

x (t ) = sin 3000t + 2 cos 350t + sin 200t cos 20t
where t is the time in seconds, determine the required minimum sampling frequency for the signal and calculate the time interval between any two adjacent samples. Solution: The third term is equivalent to 2 components of frequencies 200+20 hz and 200-20 hz. The highest frequency in the signal therefore is

3000 / 2π = 477.5hz .. Required minimum sampling frequency is 2 × 477.5hz = 955hz ,, or

the sampling interval T is

Quantization in an analogue-to-digital converter

The quality of a digital signal is dependent on the quality of the conversion processes. An analogue signal takes on a continuous range of amplitudes. However, a practical electronic analogue-to-digital converter has limited levels of quantization. An n-bit analogue-to-digital converter has presented in the sampling. -- Quantization error

During an unlimited level of analogue signal being converted into a limited level of digital signal, all possible values have

2n =8 provides 8 quantization levels. Obviously, there exists big quantization errors in representing the original

continuous signal by a small number of levels. But when taking n=12, it gives as many as 4096 quantization levels, which satisfies many industrial applications. The following Figure 1.4 illustrates the quantization process in which the analogue to digital convertor has 8 levels. A continuous signal is sampled to a digital signal as …,1, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6,… which have difference, i.e. the error, at each sampling point between the analogue and digital values.

The unit step can be regarded as a sum of unit impulse on the positive side of n-axis. The ramp signal can be a set of unit impulses shifted to the right axis and scaled by sample number n. Or it can be regarded as the unit step scaled by the corresponding sample number n. Actually, later, we will know all signals can be regarded as a sum of shifted and scaled unit impulses.

Periodic signals

A periodic signal satisfies the following relationship

x[n ± kN ] = x[n]

(2.7)

where k is an arbitrary integer and N the period. The above relationship indicates that a periodic signal can remain the same shape if it shifts to left or right by any integer number of periods. Typical periodic signals are sine and cosine waves. e.g. For the signal

 np x[n] = sin  1

 , we can find the period by following steps:  

We know that the sine function has a period of 2p . Therefore,

  (n ± 2 )p   np  np  ± 2p  = sin  sin    = sin  1    1 1 
This means that on the n-axis, a new signal after being shifted to left or right by 22 samples is still identical to the original signal. Therefore, N=22 (samples) is the period.

3.1	 Linear time-invariant (LTI) systems
A digital system is also refereed as a digital processor, which is capable of carrying out a DSP function or operation. The digital system takes variety of forms, such as a microprocessor, a programmed general-purpose computer, a part of digital device or a piece of computing software. Among digital systems, linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are basic and common. For those reasons, it will be restricted to address about only the LTI systems in this whole book. The linearity is an important and realistic assumption in dealing with a large number of digital systems, which satisfies the following relationships between input and output described by Figure 3.1. i.e. a single input x1 [n ] produces a single output

y1 [n ] , Applying sum of inputs x1 [n ] + x2 [n ] produces y1 [n ] + y 2 [n ] , and applying input ax1[n ] + bx2 [n ]

generates ay1 [ n ] + by 2 [n ] .

Output y1 [n ] ay1[n ] y 2 [n ] y1[n ] + y 2 [n ] ay1[n ] + by 2 [n ]

Figure 3.1 Linearity of a system

The linearity can be described as the combination of a scaling rule and a superposition rule. The time-invariance requires the function of the system does not vary with the time. e.g. a cash register at a supermarket adds all costs of purchased items

x[n] , x[n − 1] ,… at check-out during the period of interest, and the total cost y[n] is given by y[n] = x[n] + x[n − 1] + x[n − 2] + ... (3.1)

where

y[n] is the total cost, and if x[0] is an item registered at this moment, x[−1] then is the item at the last moment,

etc. The calculation method as a simple sum of all those item’s costs is assumed to remain invariant at the supermarket, at least, for the period of interest.

3.2	

Difference equations

Like a differential equation is used to describe the relationship between its input and output of a continuous system, a difference equation can be used to characterise the relationship between the input and output of a digital system. Many systems in real life can be described by a continuous form of differential equations. When a differential equation takes a discrete form, it generates a difference equation. For example, a first order differential equation is commonly a mathematical model for describing a heater’s rising temperature, water level drop of a leaking tank, etc:

dy (t ) + ay (t ) = bx(t ) dt (3.2)
where

x[n] is the input and y[n] is the output. For digital case, the derivative can be described as
dy (t ) y[n] − y[n − 1] = , dt T (3.3)

i.e. the ratio of the difference between the current sample and one backward sample to the time interval of the two samples. Therefore, the differential equation can be approximately represented by a difference equation:

y[n] − y[n − 1] + ay[n] = bx[n] T
or

(1 + Ta ) y[n] = y[n − 1] + Tbx[n]
yielding a standard form difference equation:

y[n] = a1 y[n − 1] + b1 x[n] (3.4)
where a1 =

Tb 1 a are constants. and b1 = 1 + Ta 1 + Ta

For input’s derivative, we have similar digital form as

dx(t ) x[n] − x[n − 1] . = dt T .
Further, the second order derivative in a differential equation contains can be discretised as

d 2 y (t ) = dt 2

y[n] − y[n − 1] y[n − 1] − y[n − 2] − 1 T T = 2 ( y[n] − 2 y[n − 1] + y[n − 2]) . (3.5) T T

When the output can be expressed only by the input and shifted input, the difference equation is called non-recursive equation, such as

y[n ] = b1 x[n ] + b2 x[n − 1] + b3 x[n − 2] (3.6)
On the other hand, if the output is expressed by the shifted output, the difference equation is a recursive equation, such as

y[n ] = a1 y[n − 1] + a 2 y[n − 2] + a3 y[n − 3] (3.7)
where the output y[ n] is expressed by it shifted signals represented as

y[n − 1] , y[n − 2] , etc. In general, an LTI processor can be

y[n] = a1 y[n − 1] + a 2 y[n − 2] + ... + b1 x[n − 1] + b2 x[n − 2] + ...
or a short form

A difference equation is not necessarily from the digitization of differential equation. It can originally take digital form, such as the difference equation in Eq.(3.1).

Block diagram for LTI systems

Alternatively, equivalent to the difference equation, an LTI system can also be represented by a block diagram, which also characterises the input and output relationship for the system. For example, to draw a block diagram for the digital system described by the difference equation:

y[n] + 0.7 y[n − 1] + 0.8 y[n − 2] = x[n] − 0.5 x[n − 1] − 0.6 x[n − 2]
The output can be rewrite as

y[n] = −0.7 y[n − 1] − 0.8 y[n − 2] + x[n] − 0.5 x[n − 1] − 0.6 x[n − 2]
The block diagram for the system is shown in Figure 3.2.

In the bock diagram, T is the sampling interval, which acts as a delay or right-shift by one sample in time. For general cases, instead of Eq.(3.9), Eq. (3.8) is used for drawing a block diagram. It can easily begin with the input, output flows and the summation operator, then add input and output branches.

Impulse response

Both the difference equation and block diagram can be used to describe a digital system. Furthermore, the impulse response can also be used to represent the relationship between input and output of a digital system. As the terms suggest, impulse response is the response to the simplest input – unit impulse. Figure 3.2 illustrates a digital LTI system, in which the input is the unit impulse and the output is the impulse response.

Figure 3.3 Unit impulse and impulse response of a causal system

Once the impulse response of a system is known, it can be expected that the response to other types of input can be derived. An LTI system can be classified as causal or non-causal. A causal system is refereeing to those in which the response is no earlier than input, or h[n] =0 before n=0. This is the case for most of practical systems or the systems in the natural world. However, non-causal system can exist if the response is arranged, such as programmed, to be earlier than the excitation. See the illustration in Figure 3.4 below.

Figure 3.4 Unit impulse and impulse response of a non-causal system

The impulse response of a system can be evaluated from its difference equation. Following are the examples of finding the values of impulse responses from difference equations Example 3.1 Evaluating the impulse response for the following systems a)	 y[n]=3 x[n] + x[n-1] + 4 x[n-2] We know that when the input is the simplest unit impulse d[n], the output response will be the impulse response. Therefore, replacing input x[n] by d[n] and response y[n] by h[n], the equation is still holding and has become special: h[n]=3 d[n] + d[n-1] + 4 d[n-2] It is easy to evaluate the impulse response by letting n=-1, 0,1,2,3,… When n=-1, h[-1]=0 When n=0, h[0]= 3 d[0] +d[-1] + 4 d[-2]=3 When n=1, h[1]= 1, When n=2, h[2]= 4, When n=3, h[3]= 0, … Therefore, the impulse response h[n]=[3, 1, 4, 0, …] ↑ where ↑indicates the position of origin n=0. b)	 Assume the system is causal. With the difference equation y[n]=1.5 y[n-1] -0.85 y[n-2] + x[n] We have h[n]=1.5 h[n-1] -0.85 h[n-2] + δ[n]

Introduction to Digital Signal and System Analysis

Time-domain Analysis

The step response is also commonly used to characterize the relationship between the input and output of a system. To find the step response using the impulse response, we know that the unit step can be expressed by unit impulses as

u[n ] = d [n ] + d [n − 1] + d [n − 2] + ... (3.11)
The linear system satisfies the superposition rule. Therefore, the step response is a sum of a series of impulse responses excited by a series of shifted unit impulses. i.e., the step response is a sum of impulse responses

s[n] = h[n] + h[n − 1] + h[n − 2] + ... = ∑ h[n − k ] =

To better understand Eq. (3.12), we can make use of the linearity of the LTI systems. In Figure 3.5, it has been shown that the input is decomposed in to impulses according to Eq.(3.11), and the output is the responses of all individual impulse responses described in Eq. (3.12).

3.5	Convolution
In order to derive the convolution formula based on clear understanding, a signal is expressed by impulse functions as following:

, − ∞ < n < ∞ , using the rules of the signal shifting and scaling described Section 2.3, it is decomposed For a signal x[n]
into a series of unit impulses scaled by the sample values:

x[n] = ... + x[−2]d [n + 2] + x[−1]d [n + 1] + x[0]d [n] + x[1]d [n − 1] + x[2]d [n − 2] + ...
or

x[n] =

∞ k =−

∑ x[k ]d [n − k ] (3.14)

∞

The above expression can be illustrated as following. For example, a signal x[n] has 2 non-zero samples, which can be represented as a sum of shifted and scaled unit impulses x[1]d [n − 1] + x[2]d [n − 2] , as illustrated in Figure 3.6.

Eq. (3.15) or (3.16) is called the convolution sum or convolution, which describes how the input and impulse response are engaged to generate the output in an LTI system. For short, the convolution sum is also represented by

y[n] = x[n] * h[n] (3.17)
where ‘*’ represents the convolution operation. Explicitly, the samples of the response by the convolution are y[0]= ...+ x[-1] h[1]+ x[0] h[0]+ x[1] h[-1] + x[2] h[-2] + ... y[1]= ...+ x[-1] h[2]+ x[0] h[1]+ x[1] h[0] + x[2] h[-1] + ... y[2]= ...+ x[-1] h[3]+ x[0] h[2]+ x[1] h[1] + x[2] h[0] + ... …… Eq. (3.18) describes the way of calculating a convolution. For manually calculating the convolution, put x[n] in normal order and put h[n] in a flipped order. x[n] and h[n] are aligned with their origin. The output sample y[0] can be calculated by a sum of multiplications between corresponding samples. Shifting h’[n] right by one sample, y[1] can also be calculated by a sum of multiplications between new corresponding samples. The following is an example.

Consider a periodic digital signal x[n], n=0,1,2,...,N-1, where N is the number of sample values in each period. From Euler’s complex exponential equation:

for each frequency k, Eq. (4.1) contains 2 sinusoidal functions in real and imaginary parts, respectively, with p/2 difference in phase. The frequencies of the functions are k=0,1,2,...,N-1. The fundamental sinusoidal function is when the frequency k=1. The other higher sinusoidal functions are called harmonics. The coefficients of Fourier Series for a digital signal can be calculated by

Fourier transform for non-periodic signals

The Fourier series introduced in previous section is only applicable to periodic signals. In general cases, the signal is not periodic, and the Fourier series formula Eq. (4.2) is not applicable. Therefore, a Fourier Transform for non-periodic signals must be introduced.

Let frequency

W=

2p k N
(rad/sample) changes continuously between 0 and 2p. This can be achieved by assuming N is

big enough and the fundamental frequency

W0 =

2p

N

is very small. Define a Fourier transform as

X (W) =
where

∞ n=−

∑ x[n] exp(− jWn ) (4.4)

∞

X (W) is the Fourier spectrum, which is a continuous function, therefore, usual round brackets are used. It is also a periodic function with a period of 2p as sinusoidal functions are multiplied in the transform.
Assuming N is big and using Eq.(4.3), the inverse Fourier transform can be defined:

Z Domain Analysis

5	 Z Domain Analysis
5.1	 z-transform and inverse z-transform
In the previous chapters, time domain and frequency domain analysis have been introduced. In each of those domains
different insights of digital signals are revealed. It is useful to introduce another domain: the z domain. A digital time signal can be transferred into z domain by the z-transform. The z-transform is defined as

X ( z ) = ∑ x[n ]z −n
n =0

∞

(5.1)

where z is a complex variable. The transform defined by Eq. (5.1) is a unilateral transform as defined on one side of the axis 0 ≤ n < ∞ . In the transform, each sample

x[n] is multiplied by the complex variable z − n , i.e.

x[0] x[1] x[2] x[3] ... z0 ↑
There is advantage in this unilateral transform definition as it can avoid mathematical inconvenience. One can shift the signal of interest to obtain a required origin in its analysis, thus usually causing no trouble in applications. The inverse z-transform can be found by

z −1

z −2

z −3

x[n ] =

(5.2)

It involves contour integration, and further discussion is beyond the scope of this basic content. However, an alternative approach is available using partial fractions together with z-transform formulas of basic functions. Table 5.1 lists the basic properties of the z transform and Table 5.2 lists some basic z- transform pairs.

Transfer function

The transfer function describes the input-output relationship, or the transmissibility between input and output, in the z-domain. Applying the z-transform to the output of a system, the relationship between the z-transforms of input and output can be found:

Therefore,

i.e., the transfer function can be obtained from the z-transforms of input and output. Alternatively, the transfer function

H ( z ) can be obtained by applying z-transform directly to the impulse response h[n] X ( z ) ), output ( y[n] and Y ( z ) ) and system function ( h[n] and H ( z ) ) in

2 A + 2 B + C = 0   3A + B + C = 0  A=1 

Introduction to Digital Signal and System Analysis

Z Domain Analysis

The z-plane is a complex plane in which the zeros and poles of a z-transform are plotted, which is used to visualise the properties of a signal or a system. The positions of the poles and zeros on a z-plane determine the frequency properties and degree of stability. On the other hand, in designing a digital system, the poles and zeros can be chosen to put in appropriate locations for achieving certain required performance.

Stability of a system

The term stability indicates the self-recovery capability of a system after disturbance is applied. If the impulse response decays with the time, the system has the capability of returning it original calm status. Therefore, the stability can be judged by whether the impulse response of the system decays to zero as location of poles gives information about the stability of a system. Consider a simple transfer function with one pole

n → ∞ . The following will be shown that the

z =α :

H ( z) =
where

Y ( z) 1 = (5.5) X ( z) z − α
is a real constant. From the above,

α

zY ( z ) − αY ( z ) = X ( z )

Y ( z ) − αz −1Y ( z ) = z −1 X ( z )
Apply the inverse z-transform to both sides, yielding the difference equation

y[n ] = αy[n − 1] + x[n − 1] (5.6)
and by specifying an input as a unit impulse it can be known,

h[n ] = αh[n − 1] + d [n − 1] (5.7)
The impulse response function can be evaluated as

Introduction to Digital Signal and System Analysis

Z Domain Analysis

h[n ] = 0,1, α , α 2 , α 3 , α 4 ... (5.8)
If the impulse response decays with time then the system will return to its initial state before disturbance. Therefore the stability requires

α < 1 in Eq.(5.8) as when n → ∞

makes

h[∞] → 0 . i.e. in the z-plane, the real pole z = α must

lie on the real axis and inside the unit circle. Consider a transfer function with conjugate imaginary poles:

H ( z) =

Y ( z) 1 = X ( z ) (z − jα )(z + jα ) (5.9)

Rearranging,

z 2Y ( z ) + α 2Y ( z ) = X ( z )
Or

Y ( z ) + α 2 z −2Y ( z ) = z −2 X ( z )
Taking the inverse z-transform of both sides yields the difference equation

y[n] + α 2 y[n − 2] = x[n − 2]
or

y[n ] = −α 2 y[n − 2] + x[n − 2] (5.10)
From the above we use

h[n ] = −α 2 h[n − 2] + d [n − 2] to evaluate its impulse response, it can be obtained as

h[n ] = 0,0,1,0,−α 2 ,0, α 4 ,0,−α 6 ,0, α 8 ,... (5.11)
It is clear that the stability condition also requires

α < 1 , in order to achieve that when n → ∞ , h[∞] → 0 .

In the case of expression in polar co-ordinates, consider a conjugate pole pair,

H ( z) =

Y ( z) 1 1 = = 2 X ( z ) ( z − r exp( jθ ) )( z − r exp(− jθ ) ) z − 2rz cos θ + r 2

where r is the radius, q is the angle on the complex plane. The difference equation can be obtained in the same way as

By evaluating the impulse response, assuming the system is causal, i.e.

Any zeros or poles at the origin only produce a time advance or delay. A minimum-delay system requires: The number of poles = the number of zeros If zeros are more than poles, a system becomes non-causal. Some poles are needed to be added to change into causal. Example 5.7: If a transfer function H ( z ) = It can be found

1 z −2 = ,, z 2 − 2rz cos θ + r 2 1 − 2rz −1 cos θ + r 2 z − 2

y[n ] = 2r cos q y[n − 1] − r 2 y[n − 2] + x[n − 2] .
or

h[n] = 2r cos q h[n − 1] − r 2 h[n − 2] + d [n − 2]
Assuming the system is causal,

h[n] = 0 when n < 0

h[0] = 2r cos q h[−1] − r 2 h[−2] + d [−2] = 0 h[1] = 2r cos q h[0] − r 2 h[−1] + d [−1] = 0.
i.e., from the impulse response it can be seen that in the system, there is time delay of 2 samples. However, alternatively, if the z-transform is given by

For poles, those close to the unit-circle can produce sharp peaks in the frequency response. Therefore, high gain can be achieved by placing the poles close to the unit circle.

Discrete Fourier Transform

6	 Discrete Fourier Transform
6.1	 Definition of discrete Fourier transform
x[n] , the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is defined as
For a digital signal
N −1 2πkn · § X [k ] = ¦ x[n ] exp¨ − j ¸ N ¹ (6.1) © n =0

where the DFT

X [k ] is a discrete periodic function of period N. Therefore one period of distinct values are only taken at k = 0,1,2,..., N − 1 .

Note that the DFT Eq.(6.1) only has defined the transform over 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1 , otherwise not known or not cared. This is different from Fourier series in which the signal is strictly periodic or the discrete version of Fourier transform in which the signal is non-periodic but defined over

− ∞ < n < ∞ . The comparison is made in Table 6.1. The DFT matches most

of the practical cases in which only limited record is available from a certain measurement. The inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is

n = 0,1,2,..., N − 1 (6.2)

where x[n] is a periodic function of period N. Distinct values can be taken from one period at

n = 0,1,2,..., N − 1

. For this reason, we can assume the original signal x[n] in the above DFT formula has been extended to a signal of periodic of N. i.e., the DFT considers a non-periodic signal x[n] to be periodic only for the purpose of mathematic axis convenience. Otherwise, the summation in the DFT formula is not to run for N samples 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1 but the whole

− ∞ < n < ∞ and to obtain a continuous spectrum X (W) . Table 6.1 has listed the definitions of Fourier series,

The upper left is a non-periodic signal with N samples in 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1 in which zeros are given to all outside the N records.

multiplications can be greatly reduced in computation. The heart of implementing FFT is to make above division further until each DFT has only 2 samples. A requirement is the length of data N is an integer power of 2. Therefore, N is chosen to be an integer power of 2, N/2 is even. 2 N/2-point sequences can be decomposed into 2 shorter N/4-point sequences. This decomposition continues until all sequences are 2-point sub-sequences, each of which requires only a simple 2-point DFT. This procedure produces a radix-2 FFT algorithm.

Introduction to Digital Signal and System Analysis

Spectral Analysis by DFT

7	 Spectral Analysis by DFT
7.4	 Digital spectral analysis
Spectral analysis for digital signals is referred to a decomposition of a digital signal into its continent components in the frequency domain. It is a useful technique in many branches of engineering, natural and social sciences, and information technology. The DFT defined in Eq. 6.1 is used to obtain Fourier spectrum for a signal, and the FFT algorithm is widely accepted as the choice in implementing the algorithm because of its fast speed. The basic assumption behind the digital spectral analysis is that a frequency-domain display is easier to reveal important information which is not apparent in the time domain. Unlike digital filtering, it is primarily investigative, not concerned with changing the original signal. The information obtained through the digital spectral analysis often leads to important insights of associated physical process.

Spectral leakage

In the DFT, the signal of length N is being treated as an exact one period of a periodic signal. If a component is an integer multiple or harmonic of the basic frequency, the wave will smoothly continue from one period to the next in the time domain. On contrary, if the component is not an integer harmonic, discontinuity will occur from one period to another in the time domain. This is particularly the case in practice in which a signal usually contains many components of different frequencies. Those frequencies can take any fractional numbers and are rarely exact harmonics of the basic frequency. The spectrum will not appear as a single line but a peak with side-lobs on both sides. This can be explained as that the discontinuity between periods causes a disturbance or modulation in the magnitude and phase of the component, generating a set of new harmonics whose frequencies are close to the main harmonic. For example, a signal with three fractional frequencies of 32.5, 137.5 and 467.5 Hz, i.e.

§ 2π 32.5n · § 2π 137.5n · § 2π 467.5n · x[n ] = sin¨ ¸ + sin¨ ¸ + sin¨ ¸ © 1024 ¹ © 1024 ¹ © 1024 ¹

(7.4)

The three components give no longer a single spectral coefficient, but three high coefficients surrounded by side-lobs, which represent the spectral leakage, shown in Figure 7.3. As a result, relative to integer harmonic cases, the leakage reduces the magnitude of the main spectral line, giving an inaccurate indication of the spectral strength. This phenomenon can be improved by windowing, described in the following section.

Spectral Analysis by DFT

7.4	Windowing
In the DFT, only a component at an exact harmonic frequency gives rise to a single and well-defined spectral line. In fact, practical digital signals normally contain a majority of fractional frequencies and few of them exact harmonics. This means that the spectral leakage is generally present, and it may lead to inaccuracy in analysis and interpretation. It is therefore common practice to taper two ends of the original signal before applying the DFT, reducing or removing any discontinuities at its two ends. This can be achieved by multiplying the signal with a suitable window function. For a signal x[ n], n = 0,1,2,...N − 1 , applying an equal length window function w[ n], n = 0,1,2,...N − 1 , a windowed signal is given by

x w [n ] = x[n ] w[n ] (7.5)
-- Rectangular window (No Window)

w[n] = 1

0 ≤ n < N (7.6) present.

The windowed signal x w [ n] is not tapered by this rectangular window. The spectral leakage is fully -Triangular window

Introduction to Digital Signal and System Analysis

Spectral Analysis by DFT

i.e. a signal multiplied by a window in the time domain is equivalent to a convolution between the spectra of the signal and window in the frequency domain. The shapes of triangular and Hamming windows in the time and frequency domains are shown in Figure 7.4. Therefore, the leakage will be determined by the shape of the window’s Fourier spectrum. The rectangular window (no-window) introduces significant side-lobs, which indicate the leakage seriously exists. The triangular window can reduce side-lobs but broadens spectral lines of integer harmonics. The Hamming window slightly broadens spectral lines of integer harmonics, but leakage can be dramatically reduced. Therefore, the Hamming window is a good choice for reducing leakage. In Figure 7.5, the effects of those three windows are illustrated.

Applications of digital spectral analysis

- Detection of harmonics of interest from noisy background A sinusoidal signal may be mixed with strong noise and hard to be observed. It is appropriate to use the Fourier spectrum to detect the sinusoidal signal from the noise. In the frequency domain, a signal may be displayed and extracted easily from noise background. In the following Figure 7.6, the upper one is the signal mixed with noise in the time domain. It is hard to observe what harmonic components are contained inside the signal. The middle curve is the Fourier spectrum where a strong harmonic appears. Therefore, it is easy to remove the recognisable noise by reducing its noise spectrum and to restore the harmonic shown in the lower plot using the inverse DFT. - Fault detection The distribution of spectra often characterises the operating condition of mechanical systems, and sudden rising of some components or any other changes in it may indicate an occurrence of fault. Key machinery or even the whole production lines can be monitored and early faults can be reported to prevent from unscheduled shutdown, which causes losses or even disasters. Vibration or acoustic signals are normally picked up and digital spectra are calculated regularly with an appropriate interval. A computer is programmed to make comparison with the historical data to report any abnormality. - Identification of unknown systems An unknown system is being deliberately excited by a suitable known signal – often an impulse or a step signal – and its response is being measured, then yielding the frequency properties of the system. See Figure 7.7. In the time domain, the input-output relationship of a system is in a form of convolution:

y[n] = ∑ x[k ]h[h − k ]
k =0

N −1

(7.10)

Note that this is a periodic or circular convolution, different from Eq.(3.16), as the signal the DFT for both sides, using the convolution property of DFT:

x[n] is assumed periodic. Take

Y [k ] = H [k ] X [k ] (7.11)
Therefore, the frequency response function of the system can be identified by

H [k ] =

Y [k ] X [k ] (7.12)

In practice, due to noise in measurement, the frequency response function must be obtained by averaging of multiple records of the input and output.
