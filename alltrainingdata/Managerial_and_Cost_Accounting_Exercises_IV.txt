Managerial and Cost Accounting Exercises IV

Problem 1

Problem 1
Amsterdam Corporation produces medical grade isotopes. The isotopes are produced in a single continuous process and Amsterdam uses the weighted-average process costing method of accounting for production. The production process requires constant utilization of facilities and equipment, as well as direct labor by skilled technicians. As a result, direct labor and factory overhead are both deemed to be introduced uniformly throughout production. Amsterdam Corporation prepared the following “unit reconciliation” for the month of April:
UNIT RECONCILIATION QUANTITY SCHEDULE Beginning Work in Process Started into Production Total Units into Production 7,500 9,000 16,500 EQUIVALENT UNITS CALCULATIONS: CONVERSION DIRECT MATERIALS To Finished Goods Ending Work in Process Total Units Reconciled 12,000 4,500 16,500 12,000 3,150 15,150 DIRECT LABOR 12,000 2,250 14,250 FACTORY OVERHEAD 12,000 2,250 14,250

The above beginning work in process inventory had an assigned cost of $4,500,000, divided between direct materials (50%), direct labor (30%), and factory overhead (20%). Additional costs incurred during April were $15,000,000, divided between direct materials (15%), direct labor (20%), and factory overhead (65%). Prepare a schedule showing the calculation of cost per equivalent unit.

The production process requires constant utilization of facilities and equipment, as well as direct labor by skilled technicians. As a result, direct labor and factory overhead are both deemed to be introduced uniformly throughout production. At the beginning of April, 20X7, 7,500 isotopes were in process. During April, an additional 9,000 isotopes were started. 12,000 isotopes were completed and transferred to finished goods. As of the beginning of the month, work in process was 75% complete with respect to materials and 50% complete with respect to conversion costs. As of the end of the month, work in process was 80% complete with respect to materials and 60% complete with respect to conversion costs.

Problem 6
Cambridge Office Furniture produces high-quality desks. Each desk is produced from a single large tree in a 3-step process consisting of milling, sanding, and cutting. All raw material is introduced at the start of the milling process. The company uses a process costing system for all costs incurred throughout the production cycle. The following data were extracted from each department’s cost of production report prepared for November: Milling Dept.	The beginning balance of work in process was $550,000. During November, additional costs of $990,000 were incurred. The additional costs were attributable to direct materials (80%), direct labor (15%), and factory overhead (5%). The ending balance of work in process was $265,000. Sanding Dept.	The beginning balance of work in process was $305,000. During November, additional costs of $600,000 were incurred. The additional costs were attributable to direct labor (75%) and factory overhead (25%). The ending balance of work in process was $420,000. Cutting Dept.	The beginning balance of work in process was $490,000. During November, additional costs of $175,000 were incurred. The additional costs were attributable to direct labor (65%) and factory overhead (35%). The ending balance of work in process was $260,000. Prepare summary journal entries to reflect costs incurred by each department during November, as well as the transfer of costs between departments and into finished goods.

Complete the schedule and respond to the questions that follow.
Beginning Balance Mixing Blending Bottling 	 ? $	518,580 570,060 818,820 	 $	 December Costs $	2,599,963 ? 1,717,200 8,477,984 $	 Cost Transfers $	(1,834,357) ? (6,082,036) ? ? (7,480,217) Ending Balance ? ? ? ?

a)	 Which department experienced a decrease in work-in-process during December? b)	 How much was transferred to finished goods inventory? c)	 What will be reported as “work in process” at the end of December? d)	 If total finished goods inventory decreased by $180,000, and the selling price is equal to 200% of cost of goods sold, how much would be reported for Carpet Clean sales during December?

Problem 8
Backyard Playground produces childrens swing-sets. 4,500 swing-sets were produced in a recent production run. The run required 1,500 machine hours, and also required four “set-ups” of equipment. Final inspection required 75 hours of inspection activity. Estimated overhead is estimated at $25 per machine hour, plus $3,500 per “set-up” and $20 per inspection hour. Direct materials and direct labor total $500 per swing-set. a)	 Apply activity-based costing and determine the amount assigned to a swing-set. b)	 For GAAP purposes, Backyard Playground applies traditional costing methods, and allocates overhead at $40 per machine hour. How much cost would be assigned to the 4,500 swing-sets? What is the per unit cost of a swing-set under the traditional approach? What might explain the higher cost assignment, and how could this influence business decision making?

Solution 8
a)	
Units Direct material/labor Machine hours "Set ups" Inspection 4,500 swing-sets 1,500 hours 4 75 hours Per Unit Cost $500 $25 $3,500 $20 $	 $2,303,000 ÷ 4,500 seahorses = $511.78 per swing-set Total Cost $	2,250,000 37,500 14,000 1,500 2,303,000

b)	 A traditional approach would assign $2,310,000 to the swing-sets (($500 × 4,500 swing-sets) + ($40 × 1,500 machine hours)). This yields a per unit cost of $513.33 per swing-set. The traditional method results in a slightly higher assigned cost, possibly because of the averaging of all overhead costs into a single cost pool that is allocated based only on machine hours.  ABC divides the process into specific activities, with a goal of determining how much of each specific activity is consumed.  In this problem, ABC produced a lower overall cost, possibly because the swing-sets did not involve as many set-ups and/or inspections as did other production activities.
