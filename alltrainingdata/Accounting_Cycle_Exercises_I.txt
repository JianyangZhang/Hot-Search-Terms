Problem 1

Solution 1
Dec. 31, 20X8   Total assets   Total liabilities Total Equity Ending Equity Beginning Equity Change in Equity $2,500,000 900,000 $ 1,600,000 $ 2,500,000 1,600,000 $ 900,000 Dec. 31, 20X9 $3,800,000 1,300,000 $ 2,500,000

a)	 Juniper paid no dividends, and no additional capital was raised via share issuances. Because there were no dividends and no issues of stock, the $900,000 increase in equity is all attributable to net income. $1,600,000 + $0 for stock issuances - $0 for dividends + net income ($900,000) = $2,500,000 b)	 Juniper paid $300,000 in dividends, and no additional capital was raised via share issuances. Because there were $300,000 in dividends and no issues of stock, the $900,000 increase in equity would require a $1,200,000 net income. $1,600,000 + $0 for stock issuances - $300,000 for dividends + net income ($1,200,000) = $2,500,000 c)	 Juniper paid no dividends, but raised $1,500,000 via issuances of additional shares of stock. Because there were no dividends, but $1,500,000 of stock issuances, Juniper had a net loss of $600,000. $1,600,000 + $1,500,000 for stock issuances - $0 for dividends + net income (-$600,000) = $2,500,000 d)	 Juniper paid $300,000 in dividends, and raised $1,150,000 via issuances of additional shares of stock. Because there were $300,000 in dividends, and $1,150,000 of stock issuances, Juniper had a net income of $50,000. $1,600,000 + $1,150,000 for stock - $300,000 for dividends + net income ($50,000) = $2,500,000

Problem 2
TOP Corporation was formed at the beginning of 20X2, and presents the following incomplete financial statements for three years. TOP has requested your help in completing the missing values for each year. Hint: Begin by solving the unknowns in the 20X2 year, and work forward to subsquent years. Remember that 20X2 is the first year of business, so TOP begins with a zero balance in 20X2 beginning retained earnings.

Problem 6
Glasgow Corporation provided the following listing of financial statement elements and their respective balances. The periodic amounts relate to the year ending December 31, 20X9, and the point-in-time amounts reflect balances as of December 31, 20X9, unless otherwise implied. Unfortunately, the company has been unable to locate its listing of assets, but all other information is complete, albeit in disarray. Capital stock	 Wage expense	 Rent expense	 Beginning retained earnings	 Utilities expense	 Accounts payable	 Notes payable	 $375,000 60,000 33,000 133,500 16,500 18,750 75,000

Revenue	120,000

Dividends	3,750

a)	 Determine Glasgow’s net income for the year ending December 31, 20X9. b)	 How much are   Total assets of the company, as of December 31, 20X9? c)	 If you were told that assets included an accounts receivable of $7,500 for services provided during 20X9, and that such transactions had been excluded in calculating the given “revenue” amount, how would this influence your answer to part (a) above?

Problem 7
Smithson Exploration Corporation was formed on January 1, 20X3. The company was formed by Cliff Smithson with the goal of conducting geophysical support services related to natural gas drilling operations in the Unita Basin region of eastern Utah. The company’s initial capitalization consisted of shareholder investments of $2,000,000 and an additional bank loan of $1,500,000. During the first year of operation, the company purchased land, buildings, and equipment in the amount of $400,000, $1,000,000, and $600,000, respectively. (Hint: In subsequent chapters you will be introduced to the concepts of depreciation relating to certain of these assets; for now you may ignore this issue). During 20X3, the company signed contracts to deliver consulting services with a total value of $5,000,000. By year’s end, $3,200,000 of services had been provided and billed under these agreements. The other $1,800,000 of work will not be performed until 20X4. All amounts billed had been collected during 20X3, with the exception of December’s billings in the amount of $250,000. The Smithson’s are quite confident that the December billing will be collected in the normal course of business in early 20X4.

Problem 8

Solution 8
a)	 Thai is unable to pay a $42,000 dividend. The company only has $6,000 in available cash. b)	 In the short run, many things will cause net income to differ from cash provided by operations. For example, various revenues and expenses may have occurred but not yet be funded. In Thai’s case, notice that $22,500 of the revenues have not yet been collected, as evidenced by the increase in accounts receivable. Conversely, $1,500 of the rent cost has not yet been paid, as evidenced by the rent payable liability. c)	 A business will generate or expend cash from investing activities (like buying and selling property, investment securities, and so forth). A business will also have financing activities that can be a source or use of cash (examples include issuing stock, paying dividends, and borrowing/repaying loans). d)	 At this point in their studies, most students will be challenged to prepare the following statement of cash flows! The student worksheet includes substantial preformatting to aid the process. Be sure to tell your students to not be discouraged by this complex problem - focus on the central theme that this it is an important financial statement. The preparation and use is the subject of a complete chapter much later in the book.
