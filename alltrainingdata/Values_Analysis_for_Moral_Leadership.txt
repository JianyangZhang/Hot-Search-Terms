VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

Foreword

FOREWORD
The three authors, Dr. Lawrence G. Downing, Dr. Robert M. Krone and Dr. Ben A. Maguad have created for the world a needed professional message on the history, and current status of Moral Leadership. Together they have one hundred and fifty years of study, teaching, consulting and writing about the value of ethical behavior and the huge range of results when ethics and morality are missing in any type of leadership. What’s equally important is that they each  are models of Moral Leadership throughout their own careers. Their collective wisdom of the subject has come from real world experience as well as serious academic research. This book, which is available free to everyone worldwide,  has a long future of positive impacts for leadership throughout public, private and non-profit  and the entire fields of education and governance. My personal association with these professionals, in one case going back to 1954, gives me the confidence to endorse this book across borders and cultures. Humanity’s future will be benefited. LEO K. THORSNESS Colonel, USAF (Ret) Recipient, Congressional Medal of Honor Past President, Medal of Honor Society

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We three authors have twelve decades of experience with the Seventh-day Adventist Church higher education system. That system was founded on Christian moral principles with Moral Leadership being taught throughout the global church structure. Specifically, we profoundly acknowledge the moral leadership model  of Dr. Lawrence T. Geraty. As an ordained minister, university president, biblical scholar and archaeologist, founder of the Madaba Plains Project in Jordan (the longest serving consortium of North American universities excavating in the Middle East), president of the American Schools of Oriental Research, university professor, author, research scholar and recipient of honors and awards throughout his career – including the award of “Citizen of the Year”  by the Riverside, California Chamber of Commerce in 2007 – he became  the logical choice  to request to review this book’s manuscript before publication. We have either worked with,  or for,  Dr. Geraty,  and were impressed by his continuous accomplishments. He is both a teacher and practitioner of Moral Leadership. We thank him for his expertise, comments and positive influences on our lives.

REVIEWED BY LAWRENCE T. GERATY, PH.D.
I have learned so much and am very indebted to Dr. Downing, Dr. Krone and Dr. Maguad for articulating so well the insights they have gained over the years of their distinguished careers. I’m sure this book will turn up on countless reading lists for classes, study groups, and conferences. I’m amazed how up-to-date it is, being sent to me the day after the Orlando massacre but already making reference to the tragic event as a huge Moral Leadership negative example.  I’m most honored to be included as a model of Moral Leadership by the three authors for whom I have had profound respect! The two schools at La Sierra University (LSU), where Dr. Larry Downing made such important contributions, are now called the Zapara School of Business and the H.M.S. Richards Divinity School. And Dr. Krone’s involvement was also with LSU’s Zapara School of Business. Continued success to all three authors, professors and leaders. We’re going to miss Larry moving away from Southern California. I look forward to meeting Ben Maguad whom I’ve known only by reputation. A tie I feel with him is that I grew up on the campus of Hong Kong Adventist College when my father served as its president. And Bob Krone, we miss you on campus where Dean Johnny Thomas and I often speak of your important contributions and lasting influence. Lawrence T.

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

Preface

PREFACE
The need for Moral Leadership has always existed. History reveals a continuing spectrum of leadership from exemplary to catastrophically bad. As this book goes to press we authors conclude that the global need for Moral Leadership is increasing in the 21st Century where the risks to humankind’s survival have also increased. MORAL LEADERSHIP IS THE ROCK ON WHICH ULTIMATE SUCCESS AND SATISFACTION RESIDES. IMMORAL OR UNETHICAL LEADERSHIP IS A SURE PATH TO FAILURE. Morality is the set of rules for right conduct. Moral behavior recognizes the obligation in society to treat others as we would be treated; that there exists in people the desire for peace, security, and freedom in their lives. Ethical study investigates the nature and constituency of human character and formulation of rules of moral behavior. It is the science of right conduct and character. Ethics is a branch of philosophy which concentrates on morality, its benefits, and its problems. Ethical study through history has created differing doctrines as foundation for the duties of individuals regarding the rights of others. People want to avoid the fear that bad, or evil, things will happen to them or their families or friends. When people are not treated ethically and morally, negative things happen. Sorrow comes into their lives. Virtue and vice are voluntary and people and organizations are responsible for which they choose. When vice or crime or unethical acts, which violate the lives of others, are chosen, stable and productive lives are damaged and environments become destructive rather than constructive. An assumption we have made is that the overwhelming majority of humanity prefers an environment where their lives proceed in constructive ways to improve the quality of life for themselves and others. The counter assumption is that accelerating brainpower to prevent failure to achieve that environment is critical for the well-being and survival of humanity. Ethical goals and conduct reflect a commitment to a higher purpose than our own selfserving ends. Moral people believe that good should triumph over evil and want to promote the good to improve the human condition. They have a desire to be examples for the next generation and do not wish to be known as the ones who harmed others or sowed the seeds for future suffering. Needed is leadership with ethical and moral behavior ingrained in its values system.

THEORY AND PURPOSE FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

1	 THEORY AND PURPOSE FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP
“Dig the well before you are thirsty.” – Old Proverb

This book is intended to answer some “Why?” and “How to” questions for readers. But before you readers reach our prescriptive chapters we will provide our own Theory of Moral Leadership as the intellectual foundation for what follows. What is a theory? A theory explains reality and provides a framework for research, prediction, and problem-solving. The test of theory is that it must be capable of being shared, reproduced, put into practice, and verified repeatedly over time. Theories fall into three categories: 1) Descriptive Theory explains “What exists;” 2) Values Theory explains and defends “What is preferred;” and 3) Normative Theory provides the foundations for “What should be.” The purposes of theory are to: understand, explain, predict, invent, improve, validate, or justify. Normative Theory, like a ship’s engine and rudder, provides direction, force, and logic to drive change. It can avoid waste or destructive trial and error. And, even more important, it can avoid failures and catastrophes if pathological theories have taken hold. Theory helps us find order in random or chaotic events and situations. The most basic definition of Normative Theory is:
A Set of Prescriptions for Leadership

The remainder of this book is the development of a set of prescriptions for leadership. Our Normative Theory of Moral Leadership, following, underlies the learning process which we believe is essential.

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

THEORY AND PURPOSE FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

The Downing-Krone-Maguad Theory of Moral Leadership 1.	 VISION. To raise Moral Leadership to be the top priority for all leaders. 2.	 PURPOSE. To increase the quality of life for humanity by eliminating the huge tragic costs and waste that inevitably results from immoral or unethical leadership. 3.	 REASONS. History provides the evidence. Science and technology by the 21st century amplifies the costs of failure while also creating revolutionary new tools for implementation. 4.	 OBSTACLES. The large number of people, groups and societies that have historically perceived benefits from immoral and unethical leadership. A global political-social culture of multiple adversities. Insufficient prevailing will of central minds of government to stress Moral Leadership. Complicated neurological, theological and psychological imprints in the genes, minds and human nature of people. 5.	 IMPLEMENTATION. Global awareness for leadership in the political, education, business, religious and media arenas to the past, current and projected costs to humanity of failure to improve Moral Leadership. 6.	 IMPLICATIONS AND OUTCOMES. There has been an increase of Moral Leadership over the past 2,000 years. But it has been incremental with periods of massive failures. Achieving critical mass positive outcomes will require general acceptance of the need and theory. We offer this one. We fully realize the enormous challenges this theory presents and admit that as the 21st century begins, the feasibility of our vision occurring seems low. But, we also believe that the awareness of damages and destruction to individuals, groups, communities, societies, nations and global humanity linked to the outcomes of immoral leadership is rising rapidly as global live communications increase. A macro cost-benefit study of the impacts of immoral leadership would clearly conclude that “Immoral leadership should be an unacceptable cost to people everywhere.”

2	 MORAL LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE AGES
“We cannot direct the wind but we can adjust the sails.” – Dolly Parton

In this chapter readers will get a montage of past thinking on Moral Leadership. We summarize views from the literature of philosophy, religion and the parables of the bible. This review is illustrative, not complete. Some of the most ancient written records are documents that defend high officials from accusations of immoral behavior. The Egyptian Books of the Dead date from the 2nd Century B.C. and earlier. In stylized form the Books of the Dead set forth a list of good deeds performed by the deceased and, as is more common, denials of negative actions that the deceased did not do. The following are found in the Papyrus of Ani from the Books of the Dead (240 B.C.) (Translated by E.A. Wallis Budge).

Hail, Usekh-nemmt, who comets forth from Anu, I have not committed sin. Hail, Hept-khet, who comest forth from Kher-aha, I have not committed robbery with violence. Hail, Fenti, who comest forth from Khemenu, I have not stolen. Hail, Am-khaibit, who comest forth from Qernet, I have not slain men and women. Hail, Ruruti, who comest forth from heaven, I have not purloined offerings. Hail, Arfi-em-khet, who comest forth from Suat, I have not stolen the property of God. Hail, Neba, who comest and goest, I have not uttered lies. Hail, Qerrti, who comest forth from Amentet, I have not committed adultery, I have not lain with men. Hail, Basti, who comest forth from Bast, I have not eaten the heart. Hail, Sertiu, who comest forth from Anu, I have not been angry without just cause. Hail, Tutu, who comest forth from Ati, I have not debauched the wife of any man. Hail, Uamenti, who comest forth from the Khebt chamber, I have not debauched the wife of [any] man. Hail, Nekhenu, who comest forth from Heqat, I have not shut my ears to the words of truth. Hail, Neb-abui, who comest forth from Santi, I have not multiplied my words in speaking. These statements provide evidence that concern for moral leadership has been with us a long time. Today, we do not have our Books of the Dead to assure our ka (soul) has safe passage as it makes its final journey across the Great River. In their place we have created policy manuals and procedures that list and define ethical guidelines. Our national and state laws are intended to hold corporations and individuals accountable for their actions. The ancients observed human behavior and sought to decipher the inner workings of the mind that produced the actions. Philosophers, teachers, prophets, shamans and gurus from throughout the world and through the ages influenced our understanding of moral leadership. Moses, King David, Confucius, Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha), Plato, Aristotle, Jesus the Christ, St. Paul, Mohammad, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine, Martin Luther, Calvin, Pope John XXIII, Mother Teresa and countless others, known and unknown, have helped us understand moral leadership and how moral leaders behave.

Moral Leadership through the Ages

THEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY ROOTS OF MORAL LEADERSHIP

Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography describes the process he established to make himself a morally perfect person. Putting his methodical, scientific mind to work he compiled a list that, when implemented, would assure his desired goal. His list included 13 virtues: temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity and humility. Under each heading he included a resolve. Under humility he wrote, “Imitate Jesus and Socrates.”1 He resolved to concentrate on each virtue for a week at a time, while maintaining the high moral ground he had already achieved. In his autobiography he relates how he created a small book in which he allotted a page for each of the thirteen virtues. The pages were ruled into seven columns, one for each day. “I crossse’d these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found on examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.2 By his own admission, Franklin’s scheme to achieve moral perfection failed. He confessed his efforts ended in “…a kind of foppery in morals….”3 Franklin’s failure to achieve moral perfection is not a surprise. In the same way, similar failure awaits the company that relies on manuals or policies to assure moral leadership among its employees. Moral values cannot be quantified, legislated nor achieved through discipline alone. Moral leaders are women and men who apply their inner values to specific situations. Moral leaders are people who have formed within their minds a set of values that guide their behavior and their decisions. Values and morals are developed through a long and complicated process. The influences that guide our moral development begin at birth and continue until death. Information, facts and training are not to be minimized in this process but of greater significance are the models we follow. Who are our heroes? Who are the people whose behavior we model?
SOME PARABLES OF JESUS CHRIST

This chapter will examine the teachings and practices of Jesus the Christ, a person who is an acknowledged moral leader. We shall give particular attention to the parables that address moral issues and human behavior. For a major portion of earth’s humanity, Jesus’ teachings provide a moral compass and challenge readers to evaluate their motives and behavior. We will examine how Jesus related to people and how his teachings reshaped human understanding of values and morals. We will identify the values the teachings of Jesus represented that have stood the test of time and suggest how those teachings apply to contemporary life.

Jesus spoke to people who lived in the real world. He addressed real situations that affected people’s lives. We will allow his parables to speak for themselves rather than provide commentary. The parable may be based on a real-life event known to the listeners or it may tell about something the listener can identify with. It is important to note that parables are object lessons or metaphors. It is the parable taken in its entirety that defines the point. The reader is not to center on the individual components of a parable. Indeed, the individual components, when examined apart from the parable, may not necessarily reflect reality nor should the parts be teased out and used to support specific theology or to create doctrine. Parables make a point and should not be stretched beyond that point.
WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR? THE GOOD SAMARITAN

The first parable we shall explore is the story Jesus told in response to a questioner who asked him, “Who is my neighbor? ”4 The setting: a lawyer, a specialist in religious and civil law, had listened to what Jesus had to say. He, as one trained to evaluate evidence and form conclusions based on that evidence, puzzled over what he heard. He may well have pondered how this untrained man could attract and so profoundly affect people. He decided to test the new teacher with a question: “What must I do to inherit eternal life? ”5

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

Moral Leadership through the Ages

Jesus responded with his own question. In essence he says, “You are a lawyer. What do your law books say? ” The man knows his ground and replies, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.”6 “You’re correct in this one,” says Jesus. “Do what you say and you will live.” The lawyer was not yet finished. “Ah, that’s the question,” he says. “And who, pray tell, is my neighbor?” The door is open for a response that will blindside the lawyer. Jesus tells the parable commonly called The Good Samaritan. The parable tells the story of a man, apparently a Jew, who was attacked by robbers and left to die at the side of the road. Three men at different times walk the road where the injured man lies. The two religious leaders, including a priest, pass by without offering aid. The third man, a Samaritan, a man the Jews despised, sees the man lying by the side of the road, evaluates the situation, and gives aid. He put the injured man on his donkey and transports him to an inn where he pays for the man’s lodging and assures the innkeeper that should the bill exceed the amount he gave, he will pay that, too. Now the punch line, as Jesus’ eyes bore into those of the lawyer. “Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?7 The man is flummoxed. He’s created his own trap and he knows it and he wants out the worst way, but there is no out! His conservative, constricted mind will not allow him to acknowledge that the hated Samaritan is a merciful man, but he must respond. “‘The one who showed him mercy.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Go and do likewise.’”8 This parable, like any good parable, is a Rorschach Test for the listener. It is too easy to offer pat answer: the moral leader is one who offers help when there is need. The more difficult questions arise when we begin a personal inventory and ask more pertinent questions: Who is our neighbor? What will be my response to the neighbor who has need? How does the parable apply to life today? Who have we passed by? What is the appropriate response to the one who has needs? Is it not important to consider the risks involved in extending care to another? These are only the start of instructive lessons we can peel out from this parable. Jesus welcomed the opportunity to challenge the power brokers’ stereotypical prejudices. You want to talk about neighbors? Fine. Let’s talk about neighbors. What about the righteous Samaritans? To the pious lawyer such a statement made about as much sense as talking about the righteous Al Qaeda. But there it was. A member of a despised race did what was right and the people of the prized race did not. The lawyer must acknowledge that his preconceived ideas will not stand under every test. An exception is found and the one exception nullifies the rule. A good parable is a lesson to be learned that the hearer must create and follow through to its end.

THE FOUR-FOLD SOIL

A crowd gathered beside Lake Gennesaret, also called the Sea of Galilee. The press of people necessitated Jesus step into a boat and push off a bit from shore. He began to teach many things in parables. “Listen! ” he said, “‘A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up quickly, since it had no depth of soil. And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and since it had no root it withered away. Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. Other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.’” And he said, “Let anyone with ears to hear listen! ’”9 The Four-Fold Soil parable, also known as the Parable of the Sower, opens opportunity to examine the context that gave rise to the teaching. We learn that Jesus is talking about responses people make to the invitation to participate in God’s kingdom. It does not take much creativity to widen the application to fit numerous other purposes. Leadership training. Sales techniques. Production models. New markets. Management skills. The parable, like a Rorschach Test, allows the hearer to give highly individualized response. This is not an inappropriate use of parabolic method. The teacher tells the story and allows the hearer to apply the lessons. Specific points grab us when we read the Four-Fold Soil parable. The seed and the sower are the constants. The fate of the seed, once it is distributed, is the changeable. Transpose seed with information or data or whatever fits the occasion, and the parable takes on a new life and new meaning. We have all seen examples of the person who is introduced to a new opportunity. She runs with it and soon burns out. Another has success within his grasp, and suddenly it is gone. And we watch with wonder when the person accepts a challenge. Maximize the potential and demonstrate superior results. Successful managers capitalize on this latter group and weed out the former, which allows us to consider the Parable of the Weeds, a parable about God’s kingdom with implicit application to a wider audience.

PARABLE OF THE WEEDS

A man sowed wheat in his field. That night, when all were asleep, an enemy came and sowed weed seeds. When the plants began to mature and were ready for harvest the field hands saw a problem: weeds in the wheat. What to do? They followed their instincts and reported their discovery to the farmer who correctly diagnosed the problem, “An enemy has done this.” Now what? The solution suggested by the field hands is rejected; they wanted to pull out the weeds right now. The farmer’s concern to this solution is that he would lose wheat along with the weeds. “Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barns.”10 This parable recognizes that we do not live in a perfect world. People intentionally seek to counter others’ success. They go about their work in secret and know their efforts will be rewarded when the good intents of their prey are thwarted by their devious plans. When their work is discovered the manager is put to the test. What is the best response? The people on site offer their suggestion. The farmer’s experience trumps the field hand’s suggestion. He allows time to work its way. Then he orders a response: Do not waste time to discover and confront the perpetrator. Now that the problem is clearly identifiable, take action. Pull out and destroy the offending plants while safeguarding the desirable wheat.

What manager has not been confronted with the suspicion that an employee is gumming up the gears or a competitor’s actions are less than noble? Who has not agonized when someone threw a monkey wrench into well-laid plans? An enemy has done this. Now what? The answer to these questions put to the test a manager’s experience, judgment and skill. The parable recognizes that not everything is what it appears. Time is the deciding factor.
LOST AND THEN FOUND

Three of Jesus’ parables describe items lost and then found. The first, the parable of the lost sheep11 tells the story of a shepherd who is responsible for the community assets – 100 sheep. At the end of the day, when inventory is taken, one is absent. The shepherd left the ninety-nine in the pen and went to search for the one lost sheep. When the shepherd finds the missing sheep he brings it back to the fold, calls the town people together and they celebrate. An asset has been recovered. The shepherd’s response to his loss is open to question. He leaves the majority of his assets to search for one whose fate is in question. Does his choice represent a responsible risk? In 1995 Maldin Mills burned to the ground. The owner, Aaron Feuerstein, told the employees that he would keep the workers on the payroll for ninety days. High risk. Using the Torah and his understanding of moral responsibility, Mr. Feuerstein felt this was the ethical response the situation demanded. The Lost Sheep Parable opens the door to consider the counter intuitive act that for the occasion is needed. The parable that follows tells the story of a woman who lost one of ten coins. She lights her lamp, sweeps the house, and searches until she finds it. When the lost is found, she calls in friends and neighbors to report her experience and invites them to share her joy that the lost is found. We learn that in Jesus’ day the woman was the keeper of the family wealth. She was the bank. To lose a tenth of the family assets was a significant calamity that might well bode ill for the careless keeper of the coins. Little wonder the relief expressed when the lost funds were recovered.

The third parable is the parable often referred to as The Parable of the Prodigal Son, although it is more than the story of a boy who ran away from home. 12 Other facets make this one of the most complex and intriguing of all the stories Jesus told. It is quite simple in its form: A man had two sons. One of the sons becomes dissatisfied with his role in the household. He asks his father for his share of the estate and leaves. The world is a delight. Wine, women and song, until the money runs out. Then the world is poverty, hunger and abandonment. The boy ponders his situation and makes a decision: he will go back home, confess his sin, and agree to live as one of his father’s servants. When he nears his former home, the father, who has been eagerly watching for his son to come back, runs out to greet him and before the son can propose the solution to his present problems, the father throws his own coat over the boy’s rags, puts a ring of authority on his finger, and calls his servants to strike up the band. The son is home. It’s party time! The music blares. The smell of roasted meat fills the air. And the second son comes home. He’s not happy to learn that this hullabaloo is for the wayward brother. The boy is really angry and searches out his father to demand why the fuss. He is angry that the father has never given him a party. He’s been the faithful son, holding to his duty. And what is his reward? In his distress, the stay-at-home son refuses to go into the house The father comes out to plead with him. No dice. “Listen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you, and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fatted calf for him!” Then the father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.’”13 Not all choices end with “And they lived happily ever after.” People make mistakes and some mistakes ruin lives. This parable assures that it is possible to change one’s mind. Leaving destructive behavior is a viable option and the father welcomed back his child. Not all will be pleased with the decision to include the wayward child in the household again nor will everyone understand why the generous acceptance, but the father understood and his opinion is what counted. How far do the boundaries defined by this parable extend? What are the limits of forgiveness and acceptance? These questions are unanswered.

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

Moral Leadership through the Ages

The Prodigal Son parable increases the loss factor off the scale. A man loses his youngest son. The loss of a sheep and a coin is one thing. The life of a son is another matter. Those who first heard the story understand the runaway son to be saying to his dad that he wishes the father was dead! The father, without batting an eye, acquiesces. In the view of the hearers, not only is the son’s request unimaginable, the father is a fool for going along with the outlandish demand. Two fools meet, might well be the verdict. Jesus does not suffer fools lightly. Little surprise the stay-by-your-dad son expresses his dissatisfaction with what’s going on. The father makes no excuse for his action nor does he argue. Instead he offers a simple statement: “Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.” Management does not always follow the logical course nor it is always called for to exercise established protocol. Compassion lies within the human soul and comes out at unexpected times and unusual ways. Give thanks when seemingly impossible situations end positive. Jesus does not conclude with a statement that there was joy in heaven over this one lost lad who is found. The father’s response says it all, and everyone who heard the story understood this.

STRATEGIC THINKING

Two conclusions jump out from Jesus’ saying. Situations arise where old does not mix with the new. They are mutually destructive. People prefer the old. A few years ago Forbes published “Management’s New Paradigms” by Peter F. Drucker.14 In this article, Drucker points out that few policies are valid for more than 20 to 30 years, yet many of our assumptions about business, technology and organization are 50 years old or older. They do not fit current reality. “They have outlived their time.”15 Drucker proposes that the answer is not to modify these old chestnuts but to toss them out and create new ones! You can’t put new wine in old wineskins and end up with a satisfactory product. After World War II Japanese automobile executives invited W. Edwards Deming to help them improve the quality of their cars. He implemented a process that American manufactures rejected. His concept was not to tweak existing assembly lines but to initiate a new concept that made quality control the top priority. Japan bought his ideas and the rest is history. You cannot sew new cloth on an old coat. The two are incompatible. Strategic management is the issue in two of Jesus’ parables. “For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, ‘This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.’ Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace.”16 We need not look far to learn the fate of the corporations, countries and individuals who failed the tests listed above. The might of Enron, Pan American Airlines and other great corporations is in ruins. Volkswagen struggles to recover as a result of a fraudulent engineering practice. Count the cost, said Jesus. Matthew 7:24–27 and Luke 6:47–49 record the parable Jesus tells to those who hear what he says are like the wise man who builds his house on a rock. Rain falls. Floods come. The wind blows and the house stands. It is built on rock. The ones who hear what he teaches and do not do it are like those who build on sand. The rain falls. The flood comes and the winds blow and the house collapses. It is built on sand. Develop a solid mission statement and stick to it. Establish sound business practices and follow them. Contract with reliable and competent auditors and listen to them. Hire good people and use them. Adopt ethical standards and enforce them. These are the rocks upon which solid companies build.

LABORERS

The Parable of the Laborers is a unique contribution to labor management discussions. Jesus tells the story of the landowner who went to the hiring hall to find people to pick his grapes. He agreed to pay the usual wage for a day’s work and sent the people out to begin their work. At nine o’clock he saw a group standing around the hiring hall and put them to work, with the assurance that he would pay them what was right. At about noon, he hired another group. He did the same think at three o’clock and at five o’clock. He had five groups; all hired at different times. Only the first group has an agreed upon wage. At six o’clock, the end of the day, the owner tells his manager to line the men up to receive their wages, starting with the last hired, the ones who came at five o’clock. When they were lined up, each person in this group received the wages for a day’s work. What a pleasant surprise! When the workers who had been at it all day came to receive their wagers, they got the same as the ones who had come at five o’clock. Not a happy surprise! These people voiced their complaint. “We have worked all day in the hot sun and you give us the same pay as those guys who just got here? Get with it man. This is not fair!” “What does fairness have to do with this?” asks the owner. “How much did we agree on when I hired you?” “The usual day’s pay,” the workers reply. “Is this what you received?” “Yea, but look, man, we worked hard and those other guys did practically nothing. It’s not fair!” “‘Friend,’” replied the owner, (note that “friend” is singular, and “workers,” plural, brought the complaints) “‘I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage? Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last the same as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous? So the last will be first, and the first will be last.’” Note: You are not likely to find this parable pasted on union hall refrigerator doors. What the parable does describe is the leeway available to managers to use as the occasion warrants. Excess does not require apology. It is called grace. At the same time be aware that not everyone appreciates excess when directed toward others. Significant questions that arise from this parable remain unanswered. A good bible commentary may assist in providing the desired information.

UNCLEAN OR EVIL SPIRIT

The gospels record a number of short, pithy sayings that share certain attributes with traditional parabolic style but in other ways are closer to comments or observation. Matthew13:43–45 is one of these. The subject is an unclean or evil spirit. “When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place, but it finds none. Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ When it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So it will be also with this evil generation.’”

Without attempting to interpret this passage and apply it to modern day understanding of evil spirits and their influence on human behavior, there are certain conclusions that can nevertheless be drawn from this brief passage. We learn that unclean spirits count humans as their home. One of these forces, for whatever reason, left its home and sought other residence, found none, and returned where it had been. Apply the above metaphor to a person’s life. Jesus says that the person cleaned up his act, got things restored the chaos that is associated with the presence of evil, but left vacant the interior. This lack provided opportunity for the negative spirit to return and bring its friends and relatives. The laws of physics will have their way: nature does not abide in a vacuum. We may root out the negative from our personal lives or our companies. This is good, but not enough. Find something positive to fill the void! In Mark 4:26–29 Jesus says, “‘The kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground, and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow, he does not know how.’” He observes that growth follows a natural and predictable pattern. The earth causes the seed to germinate. The stalk grows and produces the head which, when mature, is harvested. At harvest time, the farmer goes into the field with his sickle, because the harvest is ready. Managers study how events develop. Markets, production, personnel matters and numerous other business decisions are matters of timing and knowing when to take action. Act too quickly and one flirts with disaster. Wait too long and the opportunity is past. Timing is everything. The manager who knows her people, her product, her market and understands when to move has high probability to succeed. This is what the parable promotes. Allow things to take their natural course, and be ready to take action when all the ducks are in a row. Our conclusion is that Jesus’ parables address classic moral situations that are valid still for contemporary leaders and managers. Moral leaders will find in them dependable and practical solutions to many of the moral issues that confront today’s business leaders.

3	 VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP
“I am always doing things I can’t do. That is how I get to do them.” – Pablo Picasso

Values Analysis is the methodological tool leadership needs to evaluate existing moral leadership and compare what exists with desired standards. The Ideas Unlimited Group Survey Method can penetrate its complexities.
VALUES AND VALUES ANALYSIS

Values are principles or things preferred. A study of values in diverse disciplines will reveal other definitions. We have found this to be a simple and accurate generic definition that works for any public, private or non-profit organization. We have used this definition to advantage in higher education, in business, in politics and in society across global cultures. The values of an individual, group or society are standards of desirability and evaluation independent of specific situations. They are what humans want and feel to be guidelines for behavior. Values regulate the political and managerial decision making and processes. They lie at the heart of resource allocations. They are the lenses and filters through which the world is viewed. Values are mainly extra-rational. That is, they are only partially formulated through conscious mental activity. They develop and exist because of complicated genetic, environmental, socio-economic, historical, cultural and psychological variables rather than as a result of a rational decision process. Rational contemplation, experience and education over time may change values and traumatic or catastrophic events may alter them rapidly for individuals, groups, even nations. The integrity and quality of a system is often measured in terms of sets of values. The values set on which a school, business or social-political entity is founded will be its primary key for success over time. For those above reasons Values Analysis is an essential tool for system designers and managers. It is one of the basic three research categories. The other two categories are Behavioral Research which asks the question “What Exists?” and Normative Research which asks the question, “What should be done?” Values analysis asks the question, “What is preferred?”

An organization which has not formally approved its values set will be like a ship without a rudder – destined for random behavior and eventual failure. Leadership is the most important function of management; and moral leadership is the most important aspect of leadership. For these reasons we have focused this book on Values Analysis for Moral Leadership. We make a distinction for readers between “values” (plural) and “value” (singular). Value is normally used in the utility sense for cost-benefit analysis asking “How good is it?” or “Is it a good buy?” We use values to identify and evaluate what is preferred. They go far beyond the economic value of a product or process. The following matrix demonstrates that distinction in more detail:

VALUES VERSUS VALUE
USE For Judgment For Measurement As Indicators For Knowledge For Visions and Goals VALUES Subjective Qualitative Social-Political Tacit* Destiny VALUE Objective Quantitative Economic Explicit** Utility

*Tacit Knowledge is gained from living. **Explicit knowledge is gained from learning.

Sources of personal values are roots (family, environment, schools, peer groups, culture, professional commitments and social affiliations). Sources from organizational entities are leadership style; resource allocation choices; priorities adopted; rewards and punishments; the goals set; and the formal policies and the tacit policies (those not published but observed by those affected); position papers and vision statements. Values Analysis evaluates those sources and variables. Values Analysis is the most difficult of the three research categories because the total set of values is concealed by their extra-rational nature, by taboos, by political feasibility considerations, and by defenses flowing from fears of reprisal or criticism if all values are openly expressed or published. Racial discrimination has been a major example throughout human history. Values are often judged in binary terms – good or bad – using political, moral, ethical, religious, cultural or artistic standards. Decisions by some leadership are frequently founded in values and proceed to action with very little rational analysis in between. To be useful in our analysis of moral leadership our methodologies must lead us to more precise identification and understanding of individual, group or organizational values and how they are influencing decisions and organizational performance.

ANALYTICAL METHODS

The spectrum of methods used includes Behavioral Research into sources and indicators, Interviews, Brainstorming, Delphi Technique, Ideas Unlimited, Nominal Group Technique, Quality Circles, and the Management and Planning Tools of the Quality Sciences and Management. Readers will find references to some of these tools in this book and to all of them on the Internet. Those tools have other applications outside of Values Analysis, but they have helped to identify the composition, meanings and dimensions of the values sets of research targets. Those dimensions are often: 1.	 Values implications of policy in opportunity cost terms 2.	 Values consistency throughout the system 3.	 Trade-off values versus non-negotiable (absolute) values 4.	 Limits of the feasibility for values explication 5.	 Values mixes 6.	 Values conflicts 7.	 Values content of future assumptions, plans and projections.
IDEAS UNLIMITED: THE PREFERRED TOOL FOR VALUES ANALYSIS

Because Dr. Robert Krone is the Co-Founder and lead scholar for the Ideas Unlimited Group Survey Method, and because it has been validated across cultures and internationally, we focus on that method as the preferred Values Analysis Methodology survey method. Ideas Unlimited was invented in 1926 by Dr. C.C. Crawford. Dr. Krone became its leading advocate in 1981 and has taught, consulted and researched with the method for the past thirty-five years internationally and cross-culturally.17 The limits of values explication need further elaboration. Leadership must be sensitive to the degree to which a set of values can, or should, be explicated. The surfacing of concealed values can damage or destroy coalition maintenance, leadership authority or consensus for policies or programs. Herman Kahn illustrated that phenomenon at his Hudson Institute Seminars with a story using a family example. Picture you and your spouse at the dinner table with your two children and you decide that should a fire occur in the home, and you have time to save only one child, you will save Jim, nor Irene. Then you tell the children that decision. Obviously that exposes concealed values that should remain concealed for as soon as they are made explicit it becomes destructive to the family unit.

You can easily extrapolate that example to your personal or professional environment, or to whole companies, agencies or nations. Communist leadership in the Soviet Union could never completely explicate their social-political values which finally became apparent resulting in the demise of the Soviet Union in November 1989. The United States had great difficulty explicating its values with regard to the Vietnam War. The subsequent turmoil within the nation forced major policy and political changes. Values will be driving your entity whether you do Values Analysis or not. The analysis is difficult, even risky. But if you leave values out of your analysis they will surely influence your system in perplexing, frustrating, and inexplicable ways. Values Analysis sorts out our management theory options for practical application. It helps to identify where individual values and system values diverge or conflict. It can greatly facilitate your resource allocation dilemma. It is an indispensable tool for personnel recruitment, because you want people working with you that accept your values. But you also want people in your organization with enough differing values to avoid group-think and insure creative thinking, and are not so radically different that disruptive conflicts are spawned. It’s not easy to achieve that mix of people.

Values Analysis for Moral Leadership

Values Analysis puts logic into issue emergence and significance. American deaths in overseas conflicts becomes a serious issue, whereas American deaths on its highways, occurring at much larger rates, have never become a serious issue. Americans prefer their cars and do not prefer to lose their family members or friends in a distant war. Dying on the highway continues to be tacitly judged consistent with American values. Finally, Values Analysis gives us answers to the fundamental questions of “Who are we?” and “What do we really prefer?” Coming to agreement on those questions in the design stage is critically important. Even coming to secondary agreement (i.e., agreeing on what cannot be agreed now but acting on those areas of agreement) can move your projects foreword. In the worst case, when an absolute values conflict lurks beneath the surface, it is far better to know it before you recommend large resource expenditures for a doubtful enterprise. Our conclusion for readers of this book is that accomplishing Moral Leadership in your organization is a sure key to preventing painful and serious unethical or illegal acts and to insure long-term success for members and customers; and that Values Analysis will be your best methodology with Ideas Unlimited, the preferred survey method to accomplish Values Analysis.18
IDEAS UNLIMITED FOR VALUES ANALYSIS

The world’s primary improvement sources are ideas. Ideas represent the essence of human uniqueness. We asked Google on 28 April 2016 to search the Internet for “Ideas.” In 0.41 seconds Google calculated 1,950,000,000 results which is both evidence of the immersion of ideas in society and of the implosion of the amount of time a search for information takes in 2016. Fifty years before, such a search would have been impossible in any amount of time. Human progress accelerated when ideas could be recorded. Ideas are the tangible output of the mental images the human brain and mind conceive. Applied brainpower has been the engine for change through the ages. Brainpower created the great philosophies, literature, art, music, military strategies, scientific discoveries, constructions, creations and inventions of the world. Ideas have consistently changed the world for better or worse. Change will accelerate in the future due to the real-time capability to share ideas as computers communicate universally around the globe and into space. Since values are primarily subjective, attempting to analyze them with traditional quantitative survey methods is neither cost-effective nor useful for identifying their sources or their impacts.

Values Analysis for Moral Leadership

Ideas Unlimited is the most effective qualitative idea generating tool now in existence. The fundamental principle of Ideas Unlimited is that those who do the work possess the know-how and the ideas to improve it. They are leadership’s best innovation resource. But leadership needs a method, motivation and facilitation to allow the capture of their ideas in a non-threatening environment. Ideas Unlimited  ’s relevance to society has continually increased as public and private system leadership, over the past nine decades since origin of the method, grew to realize that the skills, know-how, problems and solutions of people are the best resource for continual improvements. It is not an experimental tool. It has been increasingly validated across systems, cultures and countries. Its scope reaches from personal productivity to international and beyond earth problem-solving. It has a huge history of past applications and an unlimited future. Ideas Unlimited collects and organizes ideas from people to solve strategy, policy, planning, program, process, task, or procedural problems. It achieves this through participants providing responses to target statements or questions. Responses can be made manually in writing or electronically via e-mail or websites. When a focus group is providing their responses, the result is the aggregation of the know-how, the ideas, the problems, fixes, improvements, and recommendations of that group. Those responses are normally obtained simultaneously, independently, anonymously, and rapidly. And they are documented in the written form and their content was originated by the responder. That valuable feature is one of many that distinguishes Ideas Unlimited from other survey tools. The method then has a subject keyword classification and data reduction protocol for the qualitative data obtained which creates a performance improvement report. It is an entire idea system for researchers, managers and leaders. Readers should fully understand that the qualitative data Ideas Unlimited generates are IDEAS. That is a fundamental difference between it and quantitative and statistical survey methods which conclude with NUMBERS. The following are important characteristics that make Ideas Unlimited the best qualitative idea generation method now in existence: Reduces the Distance between Decision Makers and Workers. An inevitable split occurs between organizational leaders and those doing the work in an organization over time and with the growth of the entity. This distance problem worsens if leadership adopts a topdown direction management philosophy while failing to appreciate the value of employee involvement. This distance problem has complex causes and is not easy to fix, but the anonymity feature of Ideas Unlimited can penetrate the leader-employer gap with ideas that the leadership can evaluate separated from organizational politics and personalities.

A Systems Approach. Every person in your focus group has something to contribute from their own unique experience. Ideas Unlimited comes as close as you can get to a systems approach to the available know-how of people providing responses. All of us need to feel important and to feel we are contributing to our jobs and to feel our views are valued. The method gives everyone a chance to do so anonymously, free of the fear of any retribution or criticism for their views. High Input Quality. Quality of inputs is high because people want to get their honest feelings to decision makers. Quantity of inputs is unmatched by other group idea generation methods because your survey population will average one idea per minute for ten minutes of response. Every participant writes responses to a “target” that focuses the mind on his/her experience for the selected subject. Politics and personalities are separated from anonymously submitted ideas which can then be more objectively considered on their merits. The total data captured forms a mosaic of specific know-how and improvement recommendations from those who do the work.

Economic Feasibility. Ideas Unlimited has been employed throughout a huge range of applications. None of those applications involved large costs to prepare or to conduct. Time conservation for people in your focus group is an important bonus advantage. Targets are usually simple statements or questions requiring responses that can be created in minutes. No multi-page surveys are used in Ideas Unlimited. Respondent time commitment is short. Your analyst time for design of application, for targeting the focus group, for aggregating the data, classifying the data and preparing the report to your client is different and commensurate with other professional idea generation methods. Democratic. Equal opportunity to contribute is another benefit. Ideas Unlimited is completely democratic. In the manual method you will have no aggressive members dominating the discussion nor timid ones afraid to speak out in front of the group, which are normal occurrences in Brainstorming. The method opens the way for each individual to express themselves confidentially in their own words, flowing from their unique experiences, education and life work and capture those words in a permanent database. Fixes Problems with Multi-Purpose Data. Every Ideas Unlimited application is specialized to solve a problem. The aggregated data obtained includes a huge inventory of performance improvement strategies, tactics and ideas. But it is rare that a problem in one organization is completely different from all other organizations. Remedies for one are very often helpful to another. The Best Practices field of the Quality Management Movement is now a sophisticated professional tool for benchmarking the successes from one to many organizations. Data from one Ideas Unlimited application is often relevant to future needs in other entities. In the Krone Associates files are databases going back to Dr. Crawford’s research in the 1940s. For example, many of the answers researchers found for questions like “How to do better with less?” in hospital administration in the 1960s will still apply beyond 2016. These multiple purposes help clients meet science standards by providing a rich systems approach to random data which can then be subjected to careful and thorough analysis leading to findings, conclusions and recommendations that will improve performance. When that performance improvement has been validated over time, the criteria for scientific-based research has been met.

Invents New Ideas. The method has the ability to bring to the surface ideas that the respondent has in his or her memory bank but which have become part of Tacit Knowledge19 which cannot be readily recalled. It can also produce new ideas that were not already there through the neurological process of Associative Memory20 – where the sequential writing of ideas to an Ideas Unlimited target produces a series of ideas each one growing from the preceding one. There is a third source of new ideas that occurs in the data classification and analysis done after all the data has been aggregated through the inherent pooling process of the method. The system actually produces more ideas than were present within the focus group. The merging of related ideas in the database by the analyst gives birth to new and/ or better ideas. No Limits to Group Sizes or Circumstances. The minimum size for an Ideas Unlimited work session is one. The method is a personal productivity tool as well as a group survey method. Although we have used the method for hundreds of people in short conference applications, we advise that the optimum focus group size for more in-depth analysis is about twenty participants. There is a point of minimum returns when the size of the group goes up and people are taken from their jobs to be surveyed, but there are no hard rules for numbers of a focus group. Increasing online experience is modifying the guidelines. Providing a target online to thousands of people is theoretically possible, although it has not been done as of 2016. The rule you should use for focus group membership is that they all have experience with the subject of your research and you have representation across skill levels, organizational functions and responsibility levels. Experience over decades with the method proves conclusively that there are no global public, private or non-profit organizations, industries or agencies which cannot benefit from the use of Ideas Unlimited. Perception of Simplicity-Sophisticated Reality. On first exposure to Ideas Unlimited there can be a deceptive impression that it is a simple tool. It actually has multiple components and subroutines interacting in complex ways. Using the manual method, people write their ideas on small blank pieces of paper which tends to give them deja vu of their grocery store lists. The best way to clarify the sophistication of Ideas Unlimited is to think of the importance of one bit of information in a complex computer program or product. The single written target response and the one e-mail response are similar. The total data captured overtime on a subject forms a mosaic of know-how and improvement recommendations which is not possible for any one thinker to create and cannot be matched by other idea generating methods. Dr. Robert Krone has been comparing methods for thirty-five years to reach that conclusion.

Macro to Micro Penetration. By interviewing a whole audience simultaneously, and repeatedly if needed, you build a database containing each person’s unique insights independent of what others think. You can capture theoretical and strategic thinking, peer into the depth of hidden system phenomena, and release the recommendations of employees who have wanted to tell the boss a few things but have been afraid to do so. There is another unique feature of Ideas Unlimited we call “The Golden Idea.” A Golden Idea is a unique one by a single responder that fills a void and causes an “Aha!!” from the analyst and client. Golden ideas are violations of the assumption that the more responses you get for a specific action the more merit it must have. A variation of that assumption is that quantitative or statistical calculations of responses will give you a hierarchy of importance. Sometimes that assumption is correct, but the Golden Idea from one person may have more merit than an idea stimulated by group-think.

Performance and Productivity. Productivity analysis creates improvement. You need to positively spot the troubles, then find remedies. You look for deficiencies, imperfections, sources of error and needs. A critically important characteristic of Ideas Unlimited is that it aims to solicit directive improvement ideas, not descriptions or attitudes. Think of all the surveys you have used or been asked to complete. Many of them ask for attitudes. Decision makers cannot rely on likes and dislikes (i.e. attitudes) to make strategic, tactical, policy, personnel, quality or process decisions. They need specific improvement ideas that can be validated by performance improvement over time. Organizational Diagnosis. Humans, thinking creatively for the benefit of their organization, are a critical variable for progress and eventual survival. A non-evaluated system will lose energy and deteriorate. The physics term for that phenomenon is Entropy. Entropy also occurs in social, political and management environments. Unknowns cannot be fixed. Diagnosis to terminate non-value added portions of the system should be periodic. The modern increases of change trends are continually shortening the periodic time needed for diagnosis. Knowing what is wrong is essential. Knowing how to fix it is equally important and often harder to determine. Ideas Unlimited will be a tool to help you individually, and the organizations you lead or work with, to meet all of those needs. Benefits Summary. Ideas Unlimited benefits are: 1.	 A research tool meeting science criteria; 2.	 Fast and relatively inexpensive; 3.	 High quality and quantity of data; 4.	 Elicits ideas for innovations that would otherwise remain untapped 5.	 Actually invents ideas both from the individual respondents and from the merging of similar ideas in the data analysis process; 6.	 Can penetrate to whatever level of detail is needed from top strategy to assemblyline improvements; 7.	 Removes the fear barrier from participants to candidly make their views known; 8.	 Reduces the distance between decision makers and workers; 9.	 Contains inherent data organization and reduction protocols; 10.	Fosters “buy-in” to the team mission; 11.	Has no cultural biases or limitations; 12.	Adapts well to online use for globally dispersed focus groups; 13.	Those being surveyed need no previous experience or training to fully participate; and, 14.	Improves performance.

The above description of Ideas Unlimited is general for any application. Following are some specifics applicable to Values Analysis. Personal Productivity. We are often asked “What is the minimum number for an Ideas Unlimited focus group?” The answer is “One.” Your personal productivity will continually increase as you learn to integrate the strengths of the method into your life. Before Ideas Unlimited, Bob Krone began an academic project with a blank piece of paper in the typewriter or computer. Afterwards he began the project by first creating a database of ideas either through secondary research done by others or primary research through targeting a focus group. Your personal authorship will improve because you have a scientific way to capture and organize ideas. And your capability to capture and retain ideas flowing to you from all directions at a conference will soar. Diagnostic Workshops. Business and management for any industry, science, the arts – everyday life has always had to identify two basics: 1) Problems and 2) Solutions for those problems. The fundamental workshop is called “The Diagnostic Workshop.” The first target is designed to solicit problems. The second target aims at solutions. It remains a valid tool, but with time pressures an interesting fact has become clear. A solutions target will produce responses that identify the problems. A problems target will not generate solutions data. So over the past ten years the single target application has become the standard data gathering beginning for a project. The Single Target Tool. With the increasing time pressures in business and society, since Bill Gates’ software connected the world, the Single Target Tool has become the most common application of Ideas Unlimited. You can capture two hundred ideas from twenty people in ten minutes either online or through a manual workshop. But its limiting feature is that it will probably produce a shallow database lacking the depth of information needed for your product.

Sequential targeting for problem penetration. When using the single target tool for the first time with a focus group the method’s normal practice is to design the target to solicit the most general thinking level. If you begin targeting with the subject sub-components you may never get brainpower applied to the overall system. But having begun with a top level general target it is likely that there will be holes in the database that need to be filled with sequential targets. It’s a judgment call you and the client need to make together concerning the sufficiency of the database. The sequential targeting is designed to capture needed indepth information on sub-parts of the problem. The purpose of sequential targeting is to move progressively from an unknown solution for a problem to capturing data related to sub-parts of the problem that can provide information and evidence sufficient for decision makers to act to solve the problem.

Interview Tools. Ideas Unlimited increases the efficiency and effectiveness of other research tools. The one-on-one intensive interview is a standard primary research method; but its limitation is the difficulty of the interviewer to document the interview. Interviewees often object to being recorded due to the sensitivity of comments they may make. We include an Ideas Unlimited single target with interviews which produces statements in the words of interviewees, not abstracted by the researcher. For instance, Dr. Krone was doing an independent review of a major university’s PhD Degree Program in Organization Management. During solo interviews with academic leadership he asked them to write as many responses as they could to the target: “How can the PhD program decision-making process be improved?” Guaranteeing anonymity to responses to a sensitive subject like this one frees the interviewee to provide a rapid written set of valuable and honest additions to the data base. It can happen in only a few minutes of the interview time and needs no documentation by the interviewer or interpretation by the analysis team. This is a good example of how merging the strengths of Ideas Unlimited with other idea and information generating research methods improves performance. Meetings, Conferences and Seminars. There is a purpose for everyone attending meetings, conferences and seminars. Sharing information and ideas applies to all those purposes. First, with regard to business meetings, Bob Krone introduced Ideas Unlimited to a University of Southern California Master of Science in Systems Management class at Hughes Aircraft Company in Santa Barbara, California. All class members were engineers who, after learning the method, decided they would spend the first five-to-seven minutes of every meeting with all present writing independent and simultaneous responses to a target designed to get data on the “Problem of the day.” So, instead of getting everyone’s ideas sequentially and orally, as normally done with brainstorming, the meeting would begin by capturing many more written ideas in less time. History of the method reveals that responders will average one response to a target per minute until mental slowdown which averages ten ideas on any target. That meeting opening database will also be high quality because responses will be anonymous and before the meeting chair expresses views that will certainly bias some of their responses.

Conferences and seminars are designed to have a full agenda with multiple presentations and demonstrations. Ideas flow chaotically in presentations, in the hallways, over coffee breaks, meals, and relaxing before bed time. We know that readers have tried many of the idea capturing routines in conferences: e.g., notebooks, tape or video recorders, notes in the schedule margins or on the backs of envelopes, or assuming that you will recall from memory the important points. You were probably frustrated later when you had no time to replay the recordings and your random notes could not be organized. The result is lost opportunities. By adopting the Ideas Unlimited data capturing and classifying procedure you will walk away from the conference with the notes you captured for your needs in a package organized into the people and subjects relevant for your future needs. We have those packages from long past conferences and seminars. They can be later reviewed for extracting their essential ideas. This is a valuable personal productivity application of Ideas Unlimited. One of the important reasons is related to mental retention of information the mind receives from different sources. Studies have shown for a very long time that most information not recorded is lost to recall in a short time. We are continually being bombarded with ideas. Without a system to capture them, few will be retained. Your advancing age will increase those losses. Rotation Targeting. This tool maximizes the brainpower capturing of a group using multiple targets representing the major areas of a subject needing attention. Rotation targeting experience has been primarily in the manual mode with groups that can devote at least one hour of mental concentration. The result is the capturing of responses to all targets on the list in a shorter time period than would be necessary for the whole group to address the targets simultaneously. The tool’s weakness is a smaller production of responses per target compared to all focus group members simultaneously writing on one target. Its strength is coverage of all targets on the list. The Question and Answer Tool. The Ideas Unlimited Question and Answer (Q & A) procedure will avoid the two common unfortunate experiences when you ask your group “Who has a question for our speaker?” Frequently there is an embarrassing silence or someone rises and expounds personal views for ten minutes. Neither event combines the interests of the audience with the expertise of your speaker. In spite of the long history of these Q & A failures, they remain more the norm today than the exception. Here is the solution. For thirty-five years we have used the following procedure which will guarantee success for the end of your guest speaker appearance:

Question and Answer Process
1.	 Distribute a blank 3x5 card to everyone in the audience. 2.	 Ask them to write on the card the one question they consider most important for the speaker to answer for the group. 3.	 Collect the cards, divide into two roughly equal stacks and ask two members of the audience to act as Questioners. 4.	 Give each questioner a stack of questions. Tell them they will alternate asking one of their questions to the speaker. Request that they review their questions and ask the ones they feel are the most important first.

Note that you have removed the question from the one who originated it who can remain anonymous and that you have added some quality judgment to selecting questions. Furthermore, you have linked the interests of the audience in this environment with the qualifications of the speaker. You rarely run out of questions before you run out of time and you have a written database of questions that the speaker can take and consider feeding back answers later to the group. Plus, you have avoided anyone dominating the session with a long exposition of his/her views.

Classroom Routines. Readers who are teachers and professors will find Ideas Unlimited to be a valuable educational assistant. All the tools just listed have been used in classrooms around the world. There is another tool that we call the “Target of Opportunity” that is especially suitable for the spontaneity of the learning environment. Ideas flow between the teacher, the students and the study materials. When a subject comes up which could be rapidly covered by ideas from all on-the-spot the group can right then design a target and everyone can spend the next few minutes in writing their responses. Procedure Writing. When procedures are wrong or don’t exist, failures occur. History is filled with examples of missing or wrong procedures causing expensive, often catastrophic, outcomes. The more complex the task, like a space shuttle mission, the greater are the costs and impacts when required procedures are not followed. The procedure for starting a jet engine is: 1) Rotate the engine; 2) Ignite the spark; and 3) Inject fuel. Any other procedure will cause an engine explosion. The Ideas Unlimited procedure writing tool does not follow the normal targeting procedure. First, it is done with small groups of people familiar with the task. Secondly, it is not an anonymous process. Thirdly, it is most effectively done in a face-to-face workshop, although it can be accomplished online. The following box has the routine for procedure writing. Procedure Writing Steps
1.	 You and your client together create the tasks for which procedures are needed. The client selects workshop members responsible and knowledgeable in the subject. 2.	 Create 3- to 5-member breakout groups. Each group is to create a separate task procedure. 3.	 Breakout groups begin their sessions by each person, before any discussion, independently writing the sequence of steps needed for the task procedure – one step per blank small data paper or 3x5 card. They write in concise language. It will take a few minutes for everyone to create their own understanding of correct steps and to have them in order on the table in order in front of them. Steps need to cover the smallest details from start to stop. This will require re-writing of some steps, insertion of a new needed step, or deletion of an unnecessary one. 4.	 When all group members are satisfied with their set of procedures they are compared and the optimum set is created. They share procedures with the group. The goal is to create one agreed set of procedures. 5.	 Each breakout group then briefs their procedure to the whole assembled workshop. 6.	 The total set of procedures goes to the client’s decision makers for final editing, approval and implementation.

Getting procedures right and in a form that people can easily understand and use will forever be a critically important facet of every activity in life. Procedures do more than tell people “How to ____.” They prevent huge costs resulting from poor quality performance. Case Studies. Case studies are one of the standard research and analysis tools and are trademark products of Harvard University. Ideas Unlimited has a special procedure that creates a case study in minutes. At a San Francisco meeting of the California Dental Association on 19 November 1988, sixty-six dental doctors followed Dr. Crawford’s instructions – each writing a dental ethics case study from their personal experiences. Their cases became the major content of a Dental Ethics textbook for the University of Southern California School of Dentistry.21 The purpose of a case study is benchmarking – to learn lessons relevant to other situations. Note that the Ideas Unlimited Case Study tool provides what happened and conclusions about it often in less than one page. Harvard Case Studies, the academic standards, can occupy you for a much longer time to achieve similar learning. The Position Report. By now you have seen a number of traditional research and analysis tools that can be done more efficiently using Ideas Unlimited. Here is one more. Staff personnel or consultants for any CEO, government agency head, university president, Board director, military commander, or hospital administrator defend their recommendations to the decision maker by presenting to leadership a report containing the important elements as listed in the following box: Position Report Elements
•	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 State the specific recommendation; Reasons for approving the recommendation; Obstacles to doing it; Implementation steps; Resources needed; Impacts if leadership ignores this recommendation.

This is another analysis tool that departs from the anonymity feature.

Tools in Development. After thirty-five years we are still searching for situations where Ideas Unlimited does not work. Technology advances, globalization, the Internet, growth of education and ever increasing numbers of professionals in all fields familiar with Ideas Unlimited results in the addition of new applications situations. The following tools have evolved over the past several years, but have not had the critical mass of applications to be in the validated category. However, there are no failure experiences with the limited applications using the following experimental tools. Future validation of these tools has breakthrough research potential. Capturing Tacit Knowledge. We have established that Ideas Unlimited captures knowledge. But knowledge is a complex human phenomenon. The knowledge we need and the knowledge that may become available to us fall into three macro categories: 1.	 Environmental Knowledge. Knowledge about the understanding, control and direction of the environment. This knowledge falls predominantly into the domain of the physical and natural sciences. 2.	 Human Knowledge. Knowledge about the understanding, control and direction of individuals, groups, and society. 3.	 Control Knowledge. Knowledge about the use of, and further development of knowledge for the first two categories.

Values Analysis for Moral Leadership

One of the very interesting science discoveries in the 20th Century was by Michael Polyani. Polyani’s research concluded that human knowledge takes two forms: explicit and tacit. Explicit knowledge comes from learning. Tacit Knowledge comes from living. Tacit knowledge is unformulated, personal, experiential and not explicated. Explicit knowledge can be articulated, and is public. Polyani published a series of books between 1946 and 196622 in which he concluded, inter alia, that “Tacit Knowledge accounts for :1) A valid knowledge of a problem; 2) The Scientist’s capacity to pursue it, guided by a series of approaches to its solution. 3) A valid anticipation of the yet indeterminate implications of the discovery arrived at in the end; and 4) We know more than we can tell.” Polyani went on to assume that tacit knowledge is a powerful motivator for seeking explicit knowledge and for behavior. There is evidence accruing to support the conclusion that Ideas Unlimited can bring to the surface some tacit knowledge people hold sub-consciously. If that evidence expands, there could be a breakthrough impact on decision-making analysis because tacit knowledge has been a missing link to date. Smart Ideas Unlimited. In 1985, four years after Bob Krone championed the return of the 84-year old Dr. C.C. Crawford and his “Crawford Slip Method” to the University of Southern California, the University granted him a 6-month sabbatical research to investigate automating the method. One conclusion of that study was that machine intelligence would someday produce a breakthrough in data gathering with that group survey method. Now it has. The beginnings of merging computers with the phases of Ideas Unlimited (survey design, data gathering, data classification and reduction, systems improvement product creation) resulted in 1995 in the renaming the updated method to “Ideas Unlimited” and the U.S. Trade marking of the name by Krone Associates in 2000. The principles of the manual method remained the same, but productivity and applications improved and increased as moving from the manual method (which is still being used ) to automated phases progressed. In 1997 the University of South Australia International Graduate School of Management asked Dr. Krone to supervise the Ph.D. research and thesis writing of Mr. Raymond Tse, a manager and computer scientist in the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department. He had led the design, programming and implementation of integrated computer systems for Hong Kong’s new Chep Lap Kok Airport – the world’s largest construction project to that date.

The focus chosen by Mr. Tse for his doctoral research was “Quality Management for the Hong Kong Aviation Department.” When Dr. Krone introduced him to Ideas Unlimited, he immediately visualized the solution to automating the most difficult task – classifying into categories the huge amount of qualitative data the method could generate from a group of respondents. His design for such a program occurred in 2000 and he implemented it in 2001 in Shanghai with his 500-member focus group of aviation professionals. That first “Smart Ideas Unlimited ” application used autonomous keyword content analysis on random e-mail responses from Raymond Tse’s Focus Group to a “Target”. In January 2002, he reported to Dr. Krone that he had obtained 60% of his group’s responses within 3 days. At their later meeting in Hong Kong, on 29 April 2002, he reported that it was now not unusual to obtain 100% responses within 3 days. His breakthrough statement was “We have achieved three months of research in three days.” We are not aware of any researcher achieving that data productivity in the history of survey or idea generation research. Raymond Tse went on in that report to point out that it was the fundamental principles of Ideas Unlimited, that motivated the members of his large focus group to respond. They were doing so anonymously with no risk of criticism or censure for expressing their ideas. They knew their identification of problems and recommendations for solutions would be considered by leadership. Their experience in civil aviation sensitized them to see potential problems in the planning for future aviation in China – thus preventing problems before they ever occurred in the design phase. And the total response submission, captured by Raymond Tse’s program, created a systems approach to subjects addressed because of the diverse backgrounds, experiences and positions of the five hundred focus group members. Four servers running continuously made possible the “three days” data capture for a subject. We will leave the full subject of “Implications for the future” to the imagination of readers and to later publications. But conclude with the fact that Smart Ideas Unlimited is today still experimental. It will take considerable more work and time to be a tool available for wide applications. But, when it is, research for any reason will benefit by order-of-magnitude increases in the availability of qualitative data obtained from people who do the work, who have the experience and know-how, and who will have new ways to get their improvement ideas and recommendations to decision makers. Neurological Understandings and Mental Illness Therapy. Science has yet to fully understand the complexity of the human brain-mind linkages.

Medical doctor Marc Valley was a United States Air Force Major and physician working at the March AFB Hospital in Riverside, California. He decided to expand his knowledge and enrolled in the University of Southern California’s Master of Science in Systems Management (MSSM) Degree Program in 1987–1988. When taking Dr. Krone’s “Systems Analysis” class and being exposed to Ideas Unlimited, he used the method for two studies for his Master’s Degree research work23 and collaborated with Bob Krone in a paper exploring the neurological processes involved.24 Dr. Valley described “Associative Memory” as the most probable brain function that produced the series of ideas respondents produce to an Ideas Unlimited target. That function is also involved when the method exposes an individual’s tacit knowledge (see discussion above). Mental retention of information received is another important brain function. Writing information as it is received or remembered both assists retention and accomplishes permanent documentation. That written documentation of the stream of ideas captured for a database on a subject accounts for the power and permanence of Ideas Unlimited. We can review the data captured by the method back to the 1940s through the written slips Dr. Crawford produced in his consulting and teaching. This 90% written feature of Ideas Unlimited is a major reason why it produced superior results over Brainstorming, in its original form, which was 90% oral before Charlie Clark merged it with some Ideas Unlimited tools.

When Moral Leadership Fails

4	 WHEN MORAL LEADERSHIP FAILS
“Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.” – Albert Einstein

Some historical immoral acts have been so destructive and cruel that libraries are filled with their documentation and their permanent negative impacts. The Third Reich of Adolph Hitler, the Japanese biological experiments with Chinese citizens and American prisoners of war in Manchuria toward the end of World War II, the Killing Fields of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1984, genocide of Southern Sudan Christians which went on for decades, and Saddam Hussein’s mass murders in Iraq are searing examples. Many instances of immoral and unethical behavior occur with less intensity and visibility.25 The business world continually gets news media coverage on stories of ethical failures. A prominent example was the Enron scandal which came to light in late 2001 as the company applied for bankruptcy. Another serious indictment fell on Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm which went bankrupt after it was accused of fraud and complicity in the Enron debacle. Since that time, other corporate names have appeared in the news either for allegedly violating the public trust or for raising questions about ethics. Earlier, during the 1980s, American industry was compelled to undergo a painful process of transformation in response to shrinking sales and market shares. Seeking answers for these problems, business firms have come to realize that their policies must change about basic values and unethical practices. Often those changes depended on their willingness to make personal sacrifices. Can Moral Leadership help an organization to avoid failures and improve organizational quality? Can quality be achieved or sustained in an immoral, corrupt or dishonest system? Is ethical and moral leadership still the most critical variable that leaders must have to influence organizational behavior and performance? Our answers to those three questions are: YES, NO and YES.

The Quality Sciences, which formally begun after WWII, have devoted a huge amount of attention to what Dr. Genichi Taguchi titled “The Cost of Quality”. The conventional wisdom of the American world of work before Taguchi was that if you want to raise the quality of a product or service, you must spend more money on it. Dr. W. Edwards Deming, and Dr. Joseph Juran began to challenge that conventional wisdom in the 1950s. Dr. Genichi Taguchi’s subsequent research and writings in Japan on the cost of quality completely rendered obsolete the idea that the only way to improve a process was to throw more money on it. Taguchi defined the costs relating to quality as the losses incurred by individuals, organizations, or societies as a result of poor quality. He took the concept of what should be measured when determining quality to a new level. The cost of quality is determined by measuring results from existing poor or failed quality. Moral and ethical failures – like stealing and corruption – destroy growth and profitability of a company or agency. In his book “Out of the Crisis” Dr. Deming states that using Taguchi’s model leads to lower and lower costs as quality improved. The Juran Institute has done extensive research and documentation into Quality Costs. The controversy of the 1970s in the United States over whether “Quality Costs or Quality Pays” has been resolved – Quality Pays. For companies with products, external failure costs occur after poor-quality products or services reach the customer or stakeholder. Some examples include costs due to customer complaints and returns, product recall costs and warranty claims, product liability costs, lost customer goodwill, and lost sales. In service organizations, these costs can take the form of interrupted service, delays in waiting to obtain service, excessive time in performing the service, errors made in billing, delivery or installation, or unnecessary service. Lawsuits brought about by the government or private individuals are examples of external failure costs that can result from unethical behavior.

The Cost of Quality concept can be very meaningful to any organization because of the idea that failure costs can be reduced through Moral Leadership and through marginal, discretionary investments in prevention and even appraisal activities. Ethics failures may be classified as either moral or economic. Moral failures may or may not entail a monetary cost. Nevertheless, even on moral grounds alone, strong ethics standards are vital to the promotion of a healthy society. Economic failures, on the other hand, entail some monetary cost which affects the organization’s profitability. In the past, organizations have addressed the failure costs associated with blatant ethical violations such as large legal judgments, prison terms, anti-trust litigation, lost goodwill or any negative responses from external stakeholders. Customers expect reliable products and minimal defect rates from good and service providers. It is unethical to deliver defective products knowingly to them. Socially responsible organizations also work hard to protect the environment which is increasingly seen as a significant ethical concern. Consequently, more of them implement recycling programs and improve their environmental practices. The costs of external ethics failures can be very staggering and, for industry, that can amount to billions of dollars every year. These costs typically account for a substantial portion of the total external failure cost of quality. Preventing these costs will yield great economic benefits for the organization.

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

When Moral Leadership Fails

Internal ethics failure costs are reflected in the barely noticed behavior patterns in the organizational social system or operating culture which inhibit operating performance. Employees encounter ethical dilemmas in their work every day. Such dilemmas range from conflicts of interest to sexual harassment, inappropriate gifts to organizational personnel, unauthorized payments, shady customer dealings, biased evaluation of personnel, and pressure to compromise personal standards. These internal ethics failures are rarely visible on the ethics policy radar screen because in many instances employees choose not to disclose their wrongdoings or those of their colleagues and therefore those incidents are not typically reflected in external failure costs. They go largely unnoticed and unmanaged. Over half of all documented quality costs could be attributed to the cost of ethics failures. Ethics programs and audits are directed towards preventing and detecting ethics failures. Ethics programs are organizational units responsible for developing ethics initiatives in the organization which include developing and disseminating codes of conduct, training on standards of conduct, administering some type of hotline or advice line for employees, and providing a means to report misconduct. The presence of ethics programs serves as a deterrent against potential employee misconduct. Also, employees generally perceive that those who violate their organization’s code of conduct will be held accountable so that they are less likely to compromise organizational standards. The cost of developing ethics programs represents part of the prevention component of the cost of quality. A good ethics policy incorporates early warnings and checks and balances, not just to catch and punish wrongdoers but also to pinpoint emerging risks and prevent ethics failures. Ethics audits, on the other hand, are employed to assess an organization’s ethical climate or programs. The cost of quality concept also helps to demonstrate that high quality cannot be achieved or sustained in an immoral, corrupt, or dishonest system. The success of any quality program depends on the effectiveness of many collective efforts. This collectiveness cannot be accomplished by administrative action alone. It needs an environment where good ethics is practiced with administration as its champion. In a genuine quality improvement program, there is no room for selfishness, moral exclusion, abusive management styles or policies, or ethical compromises. Such things will derail collective efforts and teamwork which is a vital component of quality management. Without a deep commitment from top executives to develop a healthy culture based on fairness, open communication, shared information, and teamwork, which are critical ingredients of quality management, the risk of failure for quality programs can be very high. If the question “Can quality be achieved or sustained in an immoral, corrupt or dishonest system?” were submitted to any population or group of quality professionals, the authors are convinced that the response would be a resounding “NO”. Moral advocates through the ages have confirmed the need for honesty, integrity, ethics, fairness, dependability, transparency, trustfulness and character in leadership.

5	 BUILDING YOUR PERSONAL FOUNDATION FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP
“You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” – Gandhi

The Need. Evidence is abundant that there exists a need for moral leadership. The need will continue to increase with the ever increasing human and material costs of its failure. Moral Leadership is essential for all of humanity. Responsibility. Readers of this book are, or will be, leaders in your schools, churches, government agencies, businesses, communities, military units, foundations, non-profit organizations, hospitals, banks, financial organizations or your families. You have the responsibility to be a moral leader, to help others be so, to prevent failures and to design codes of ethics for your organizations. The Components of Moral Leadership. Moral Leadership is a tough subject in our complex world. Formalizing the set of rules for right conduct runs into cultural, religious, cognitive and philosophical diversities. Initially it will raise more questions for you than it provides answers. An initial list of places to begin your study is as follows: 1.	 Using the world’s religions to define “Good and Moral Conduct”. 2.	 Studying philosophy to define “The Truth,” “Systems of Knowledge,” and “Wisdom”. Philosophy is the science of sciences. It includes ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics and aesthetics. 3.	 Values analysis. Values are “Principles or Things Preferred ” by individuals, groups, religions, organizations, cultures or nations, or international entities. We maintain throughout this book that Values Analysis is the best methodology for understanding people’s and groups’ beliefs and behavior. 4.	 Ethics. Ethical study investigates the nature and constituency of human character and formulation of rules of moral behavior. Designing a “Code of Ethics” for yourself and your organization can be a valuable contribution to Moral Leadership.

The Internet has revolutionized our ability to search for information. Try searching for the key words “Moral Leadership” and see what you get. For the best analysis of why public moral leadership is needed, start with Yehezkel Dror’s modern classic Capacity To Govern, 2001 (Frank Cass Publishers on amazon.com). 7.	 Continual learning. Being a moral leader in our era characterized by uncertainty, novelty, complexity and adversity may be your most difficult professional and personal challenge. There are pitfalls and dilemmas. Defining and achieving your own personalized foundation for moral leadership will take time and will mature as you advance through your career and life.

Humankind’s Future and Moral Leadership

6	 HUMANKIND’S FUTURE AND MORAL LEADERSHIP
“You will not do incredible things without an incredible dream.” – John Eliot

Readers having read the previous five chapters will recognize that we three authors believe that Moral Leadership is a universal requirement for any society anywhere. So Moral Leadership should exist for humans living anywhere in the universe. How can readers of this book become active in a movement to continually expand moral leadership throughout humanity? A practical and effective option is for leaders to take an active role in promoting positive values and practices in their organization and communities. Today, there is abundant evidence to support such action. For example, the June 12, 2016 Orlando, Florida, USA massacre of forty-nine people that caused severe injuries to more than 50 others and had profound effect upon thousands of others across America and the world, turns attention once more to consider how best to prevent immoral acts perpetrated upon innocent people. The wanton act of violence upon those assembled in a gay club by a young terrorist, the deadliest mass murder in the United States criminal history, reminds us how important it is to instill values and morals in our young people that counter the hate and calls to violence that have encouraged those who seek to harm others. People cannot feel secure as long as evil has such a prominent role in our society. Laws by themselves will not change behavior. Limitations on human behavior will have but moderate success. More effective than the multiplication of civil regulation is a change of heart, a fundamental shift in attitude and a mind that seeks good above ill. Moral leaders are an important component in the effort to improve how we treat one another and the value we place upon human life. Now is the time to take positive action that will promote the basic values and morals that promote and perpetuate those behaviors that benefit life. A passive role, a decision to ignore the evil that surrounds and destroys will not cut it. Moral leadership will continue to play a significant role in shaping life today and into the future. Our plea is that women and men of good will do not let this opportunity pass. Take action now!

Humankind’s Future and Moral Leadership

A primary reference for you is the classic Yehezkel Dror 2014 book, Avant-Garde Politician: Leaders for a New Epoch, Washington, D.C., Westphalia Press. Dror, in this fourteenth book of his brilliant career as Co-Founder and leading scholar of The Policy Sciences, takes a time perspective of 100 years with prescriptions to shape the future of humanity – including the essential requirement of Moral Leadership. We summarize for you a few of Yehezkel Dror’s guidelines in this chapter with the full understanding that earth’s literature, past and present – now readily available worldwide – provides a storehouse of wisdom to defrost and apply to this challenge. We cite here the Yehezkel Dror writings as unmatched models for your personal research and involvement. Furthermore, we assume that currently, in 2016, there exists the human capacity to positively shape the future for the benefit and survival of humanity. The missing link presently is a universal commitment of global leadership and citizens to do so. The following short statements describe the existing situation today: 1.	 Humanity collectively is unprepared for coping with future challenges. 2.	 Without global political leadership increased awareness and actions, the probability of human extinction will increase, until it occurs. 3.	 “Continued sleepwalking by political leaders on critical issues assures disasters.” (Dror, op. cit., p. 3). 4.	 Much is known today about the failings of public and private leaders as uncovered by investigative media. Unethical and immoral behavior is revealed continuously. 5.	 “Based on my personal acquaintance with the corridors of power in many countries having different regimes, my finding is that many political leaders perform much worse than is publicly known.” (Dror, op. cit. p. 5). 6.	 There are increasingly novel critical issues, such as deep globalization, economic crises, unprecedented geopolitical shifts, greenhouse deterioration, explosive demographic pressures, technologies with uncertain long range impacts, fanatics armed with mass killing devices, and violent culture clashes. 7.	 Despite some optimistic outlooks about self-managing social processes, or governance leadership to be predicting major future improvements, the trend is toward increasing severity of problems. This is dangerous because political leaders are the only ones legitimately in charge of regulating or reversing social actions through instruments they create. 8.	 We come to face the finding and conclusion that leadership will be the key to the design of future human actions that determine how developments turn out. 9.	 We further conclude that of all the necessary characteristics of leadership, Moral Leadership will remain the most influential – for good or for bad – just as it has throughout recorded history on earth.

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

Humankind’s Future and Moral Leadership

Future Challenges Achieving moral leadership at a societal level will require human behavioral changes for which the means for doing so are currently unknown. We hope they will be found. If those changes remain impossible on Earth, is there the possibility of creating them in future human space settlements? We agree with the philosophy prescribed by the Kepler Space Institute (KSI) for human settlements in space, which is “Reverence for Life within Ethical Civilizations.”26 The hypothesis of Kepler Space Institute leadership is that the vision of Reverence for Life within Ethical Civilizations can be achieved by establishing it in the planning for all future Space settlements through their implementation guided by the Policy Sciences; and, furthermore, that achieving it in space settlements will feedback as models for earth societies. Space has no history of human conflict, intolerance, discrimination, violence, genocide, wars or human catastrophes.

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

Humankind’s Future and Moral Leadership

At the International Space Development Conference (ISDC-2016), in San Juan, Puerto Rico, May 22, 2016, The Kepler Space Institute chaired a panel to begin a research program for “Human Pathologies and the Space Epoch.” The purpose of the panel was to assist long time desires to heal these human pathologies including immoral and unethical leadership. The emerging Space Age opens up unprecedented new opportunities by using the exploration, development and human settlement of space to be the catalyst for human societies’ paradigm shift. Humanity’s health and progress – even its long-term survival – is at stake. A research question which will be pursued is: “How can the emerging space age be designed to avoid repetition of humanity’s destructive history on earth?” Readers interested in becoming involved in the research, or getting results of it, can contact Dr. Bob Krone at BobKrone@aol.com.

Guidelines for Teachers

7	 GUIDELINES FOR TEACHERS
“In everything do to others as you would have them do to you.” – Jesus Christ

A good way to begin teaching Moral Leadership is the “Benefit-Cost Method.” Have some dramatic real world cases which are examples of all the good that can occur when individuals, or groups, have high moral and ethical standards; and then share examples of the destructiveness and misery which result from opposite cases. Ask the students to each bring to the next class session the best and worst cases they have experienced. The following are some questions that you can have to stimulate discussion: 1.	 Can people learn how to be moral leaders or is moral leadership a natural gift that can be enhanced through experience? Explain you answer(s). 2.	 How can one quantify moral leadership? 3.	 What is the payoff for those who implement moral leadership? 4.	 Do you agree that no single factor has a bigger impact on the ethicality of an organization’s culture than the personal examples set by its leaders? 5.	 What do you think is the most important attribute of an effective moral leader? 6.	 How important is it for leaders to do the right thing even if no one will ever know about it? 7.	 Is it fair to put responsibility on leaders of organizations to be role models for their employees? 8.	 How can leaders best communicate their organization’s ethical norms to employees? 9.	 Are you willing to take a moral stand even if your peers and authority figures disagree?

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

Guidelines for Teachers

The description and theory of Moral Leadership we have provided in this short text will help you with answers to the questions of “What is Moral Leadership?” and “How is it measured?” But more complicated problems come from human behavior flowing from genetics or environmental influences that lead people in one direction or the other. The field of psychoanalysis devotes attention to helping individuals become aware of their selfdestructive behavior, then guide them into therapeutic ways to change that behavior. This can often take years and that process must begin with the individual desiring help. Forcing behavioral change on others rarely works. And when the behavior comes from learning based on a prevailing social-political philosophy, there will not be the awareness of its pathologies during the learning years. Teachers attempting to address that problem get trapped in existing cultures and belief systems, often leading to risks for their own careers. History reveals continual problems, conflicts – even wars – resulting from incompatible values systems and leadership that has been successful within those values system.

At Navigant, there is no limit to the impact you can have. As you envision your future and all the wonderful rewards your exceptional talents will bring, we offer this simple guiding principle: It’s not what we do. It’s how we do it.

VALUES ANALYSIS FOR MORAL LEADERSHIP

Guidelines for Teachers

Teaching moral leadership can open a Pandora’s Box for you where the emerging genies cannot be put back into their boxes. Before you launch your own Moral Leadership teaching, you need to be fully aware of the culture, the social-political ideologies, and the trends your environment is following. Our position is that not everything politically feasible will be desirable, only that you are aware of how your personal values and belief system fit into that environment as you teach others. We are including some of the complexities of teaching, and learning Moral Leadership in this final chapter. Professor Yehezkel Dror, the co-founder and leading scholar of the Policy Sciences, sums up the importance of the task for those in public leadership position, in his 2015 Article, “Preventing Hell on Earth.”27
“To avoid catastrophes, including much Hell on Earth, and to increase the likelihood of pluralistic human thriving, it is absolutely essential to assure a much higher level of moral, mental and volitional qualities of political leaders.”

There may be no more important subject for us teachers and students than our pursuit of the vision to achieve universal Moral Leadership.

The official text for it is Dr. Bob and Sue Krone, 2007, Ideas Unlimited: Capturing Global Brainpower, Infinity Press and Amazon.com. 18.	 Dr. Robert Krone decided “After a life of diverse professional activities, including earning a doctor of philosophy degree and editing the Journal of Space Philosophy, to evaluate with Values Analysis the origins and evolution of my own values and philosophy,” and published it in the article titled “A Personal Philosophy.” In the Journal of Space Philosophy 3, No. 2 (Fall 2014), pp. 71–89. It covers his 84 years of life to 2014 (www.bobkrone.com/node/120). 	 Also his video interview, “The Power of Values.” Made by ProLeadership Founder, Dr. Assegid Habtewold can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCSiuO8YP6E&list=UU2AvdK6_3mGgyky6T82 QBMQ 19.	 Tacit Knowledge is knowledge gained from living, as opposed to Explicit Knowledge, which is knowledge gained from learning. Much of Tacit Knowledge remains sub-conscious and cannot be recalled with normal thinking processes. See the many publications of scholar Michael Polyani (1891–1967), considered the originator of the term. See Chapter 9. 20.	 The linkage of Associative Memory to Ideas Unlimited was first recognized by Marc A. Valley, MD, who was earning his MBA at the University of Southern California. As one of his professors Bob Krone introduced him to the method which he employed for his MBA study, “Southern California Medical Consortium: A Systems Model ” 22 December 1987. Krone and Valley later coauthored the paper Marc A. Valley, MD, MSSM and Robert M. Krone, Ph.D. “Crawford Slip Method Theory: Management and Neurological Sciences,” (1 February 1992).
