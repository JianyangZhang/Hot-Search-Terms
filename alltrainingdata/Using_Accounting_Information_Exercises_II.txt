Problem 1

Problem 1
Mr. Mac Corporation has no material problem with uncollectible accounts or obsolete inventory. All sales and purchases are on account. The company provided the following information for the year ending 20X5: Total sales 	 $	 1,560,000 350,000 1,080,000 25,000 1,440,000 925,000 1,065,000

Beginning accounts receivable		 Total purchases of inventory		 Beginning inventory		 Collections on accounts receivable		 Payments on accounts payable		 Cost of goods sold		

a)	 Calculate the “accounts receivable turnover ratio.“ b)	 Calculate the “inventory turnover ratio.“ c)	 If Mac’s competitors have a receivables turnover ratio of “7“ and an inventory turnover ratio of “5,“ would you initially conclude that Mac is better or worse than its competitors in managing receivables and inventory?

Worksheet 1
a)	 Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales/Average Net Accounts Receivable* =

b)	 Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold/Average Inventory** =

c)

Problem 1

Solution 1
a)	 Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales/Average Net Accounts Receivable* = $1,560,000/[($350,000 + $470,000)/2] = $1,560,000/$410,000 = 3.80 * Ending accounts receivable = $350,000 + $1,560,000 sales – $1,440,000 collections = $470,000 b)	 Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold/Average Inventory** = $1,065,000/[($25,000 + $40,000)/2] = $1,065,000/$32,500 = 32.77 ** Ending inventory = $25,000 + $1,080,000 purchases – $1,065,000 cost of goods sold = $40,000 c)	 Mac is doing much better than its competitors as it relates to managing inventory (32.77 vs. 5), but is lagging behind as it relates to collecting receivables (3.80 vs. 7).

Problem 2
Beverly Monson is the chief financial officer for Monson Construction. She delivered the following comments in a recent conference call with analysts that follow the company: “20X7 was another excellent year. Net income was a record setting $3,500,000. We maintained our overall net profit on sales at the historic 15% level. This occurred despite an increase in raw material costs that lowered our gross margin to 45%. We are proud that we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet that is free of any liablities. All of our financing continues to be provided by our common and preferred shareholders. Our beginning of year equity of $65,000,000 was sufficient to fund our capital needs, and no additional shares were issued this year. Our “4% preferred shareholders“ have again received their full $1,500,000 in dividends for the year. The remaining earnings have been reinvested in the company.“ a)	 Use profitability ratios to determine Monson’s sales, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and net income. b)	 Calculate Monson’s return on assets and return on equity. Which is higher, and why?

b)	 Return on Assets Ratio = (Net Income + Interest Expense) ÷ Average Assets =

Return on Equity Ratio = (Net Income – Preferred Dividends) ÷ Average Common Equity =

Solution 2
a)	
Sales Cost of goods sold Gross profit Selling, general & administrative Net income 100% 55% 45% 30% 15% $	52,500,000 28,875,000 $	23,625,000 20,125,000 $	3,500,000

b)	 Return on Assets Ratio = (Net Income + Interest Expense) ÷ Average Assets = ($3,500,000 + $0) ÷ ($65,000,000 + ($65,000,000 + $3,500,000 – $1,500,000))/2 = 5.303%

Problem 2

Return on Equity Ratio = (Net Income – Preferred Dividends) ÷ Average Common Equity = ($3,500,000 – $1,500,000) ÷ ($27,500,000* + ($27,500,000 + $3,500,000 – $1,500,000))/2 = 7.018% * Beginning common equity = $65,000,000 – preferred equity ($37,500,000) = $27,500,000 Preferred equity = $1,500,000 dividend ÷ 4% = $37,500,000 Return on equity is higher than return on assets because the overall rate of return (5.303%) is higher than the 4% dividend on preferred equity. Essentially, the company is obtaining 4% financing from preferred shareholders, and deploying this capital to earn a higher rate of return. The benefit of this strategy is reflected in the higher rate of return for common shareholders.

The accountant for Quick Cafe used a spreadsheet to prepare information needed to prepare the statement of cash flows for the year ending December 31, 20X6. However, the data were accidentally sorted alphabetically into the following listing of items. To compound the problem, the “add“ and “subtract“ notations for each line item were also deleted. Review the information, and prepare a correct presentation, using the indirect approach. The beginning cash balance was $95,700, and the ending cash balance was $622,500.

Problem 4
Cambridge Corporation reported net income of $200,000 for 20X8. The income statement revealed sales of $2,000,000; gross profit of $1,040,000; selling and administrative costs of $680,000; interest expense of $40,000; and income taxes of $120,000. The selling and administrative expenses included $50,000 for depreciation. No equipment was sold during the year. Equipment purchases were made with cash. Prepaid insurance included in the balance sheet related to administrative costs. All accounts payable included in the balance sheet relate to inventory purchases. The change in retained earnings is attributable to net income and dividends. The increase in common stock and additional paid-in capital is due to issuing additional shares for cash. Using the direct approach, prepare a statement of cash flows (excluding the supplemental reconciliation of net income to operating cash flow) for Cambridge for the year ending December 31, 20X8. Comparative balance sheets for Cambridge follow.

Accounts payable and accounts receivable relate solely to purchases and sales of inventory. The increase in land resulted from the purchase of land via issuance of the long-term note payable. No buildings were purchased or sold. Equipment was purchased. In January of 20X8, equipment with an original cost of $56,250 was sold for $37,500. The increase in paid-in capital all resulted from issuing additional shares for cash.
