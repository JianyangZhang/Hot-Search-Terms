Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Introduction

Introduction
Author´s Name: Somesh K Mathur1, PhD (skmathur@iitk.ac.in, smathur@ute.edu.ec) Name of the Institution: HSS, IIT Kanpur (www.iitk.ac.in), India and ITT, UTE, Quito, Ecuador Short Abstract: This book is on trade in Climate Smart Goods and Other Specialized Products of Ecuador. The interest in the subject of Trade in Climate Smart Goods was fuelled by Ecuador’s positive trade balance with the rest of the Andean Community and MERCOSUR region in 2010. This may be a reflection of Ecuador’s maturity in dealing with environmental issues since the early 1980s.The study is also able to identify some specialized industries and identify markets for the two digit and 6 digit industries for Ecuador using RCA and Export Specialization indices. There are 20 such products at the two digit level and 238 products/ industrial codes at 6 digit level disaggregation in 2010 where in Ecuador has a comparative advantage in production. These industrial sectors are potential for inviting FDI into Ecuador. The study further identifies CSG goods in which Ecuador has advantage in production and its trade. The study then uses simulations done through SMART analysis(within WITS) for evaluating the relative benefits of tariff liberalization of CSG and specialized goods( both for 20 and 238 products) with MERCOSUR, China, Japan and the US, and EU27 separately by giving numbers to trade creation, trade diversion, revenue, welfare and consumer surplus effects of liberalizing trade in 2010. The study at the end then uses a variant of Baier and Bergstrand (2001) gravity formulation for working out the basis of trade and export potential in CSG and trade in 20 products of Ecuador in 2010. National and International Policies are recommended for promoting CSG goods at country and regional level.

Long abstract
The book works out different trade indices based on trade data of Ecuador from 2002 through 2010.The study calculates RCA and Export Specialization Index, among others, to identify 20(at 2 digit level disaggregation) and 238 products( at 6 digit level disaggregation)and their markets of Ecuador in 2010. The paper also used 64 goods list of Climate Smart Goods used in APTIR, UNESCAP (2011,a,b). The Trade in CSG will help Ecuador to promote alternative industries in the face of Global Economic Downturn. Also, it will help countries to look for safe, alternative and reliable energy source rather than believing in trade of crude and Petroleum Oil only or investing a great deal in nuclear energy. Nuclear energy was in the brink of being affected in Japan due to recent Earthquake in Japan. Ecuador can direct its social spending in promoting small industries which can provide CSG goods (low carbon emanating goods) at low cost. Identification of goods for diversifying Ecuadorian economy is also done using different trade indices. The study then uses simulations done through SMART analysis( within WITS) for evaluating the relative benefits of tariff liberalization of CSG and specialized goods( both for 20 and 238 products) with MERCOSUR, China, Japan and the US, and EU27 separately by giving numbers to trade creation, trade diversion, revenue, welfare and consumer surplus effects of liberalizing trade in 2010. One finds that for Ecuador it is beneficial to trade in 20(2digit level) and 238 products(at 6 digit level) with the MERCOSUR trading partners while for trade in CSG it is better to liberalize trade with the Japan, the US and the China, the main suppliers (exporters)of CSG products.

Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Introduction

The study at the end then uses Baier and Bergstrand (2001) gravity formulation for working out the basis of trade and export potential in CSG and trade in 20 products of Ecuador in 2010. National and International Policies are recommended for promoting CSG goods at country and regional level. One finds that there is export potential of 34 million US $ in CSG to four Latin American trading partners of Ecuador. The four Latin American Countries are Bolivia, Chile, Columbia and Peru. This is less than the export potential when Ecuador liberalizes its trade of CSG with China, Japan and the US. Theoretical justification of the Gravity formulation used is given along with equations of Trade Creation and Trade Diversion. The latter will depend on the import demand elasticity, substitution elasticity and supply elasticity. Small country assumption is made while pursuing SMART analysis in WITS. The study has three main specific objectives. The three main specific objectives of the book are the following 1.	 Work out different trade indices based on trade data from 2002 through 2010 for Ecuador. Understand the trade relations of Ecuador with its trading partners for total trade, some selected products and trade in CSG(Climate Smart Goods2) using some of the trade indices and trade and tariff data from the World Integrated Trade Solution(WITS) software. The indices include Export share of Ecuador in World Exports, Product Concentration and Market Concentration of Ecuadorian Exports, Revealed Comparative Analysis, Export Specialization Index, Trade Complementarity and Trade Intensity Indices, Export Diversification and Herfindahl- Hirschman indices of trade concentration .The above indices will help us to examine the role of international trade of Ecuador over the years(Export share in World Exports) and perform comparative analysis with other nations and regional groups over the years, identify the specialized products of Ecuador and their markets over the years by examining the changing comparative advantage in production of some products (RCA and Export Specialization Indices), also identify the extent of matching of Ecuadorian products with its trading partners (Trade Complementarity index), its intensity of trade relations with its trading partners
2	CSG are defined as components, products and technologies which tend to have relatively less adverse impact on the environment. CSGs constitute low carbon technologies such as solar photovoltaic systems, wind power generation, clean coal technologies and energy-efficient lighting. Trade and investment in CSGs and climate-smart services have recently received much attention as a triple win scenario where trade, climate and environment, and development all benefit (UNESCAP,2011,a,b).The study is able to define 64 such goods under 6 digit HS code(2002) by putting together various lists that have been defined by various international organizations recently. The list is arrived by defining concordance series from series of list given by the World Bank, ICTSD, WTO, APEC and the OECD. The study consider these 64 CSG as one category and calculates the below mentioned trade indicators for this category. This list builds on the 43-product list amalgamated by the World Bank, which was tabled as an initial starting point for discussions. The list at UNESCAP proposes an additional 21 products that appeared on one of the recent ICTSD lists (Renewables and Buildings) and also on the APEC, OECD or WTO list. In total, the list comprises of 64 climate smart goods classified by H.S. 2002 codes at the 6-digit level. The 64 goods list is attached below in the appendix I. The term “climate smart” was chosen over the previously used classification of “climate friendly” owing mainly to the fact that many goods/technologies contained within the UNESCAP list are not only “friendly” to the climate (i.e. assist in mitigation efforts by reducing GHG emissions), but also contribute to fostering “climatesmart” development by improving adaptive capacity such as by conserving water or by improving access to energy.

Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Introduction

(Trade Intensity Index) , share of specialized and CSG products in exports of Ecuador(Product Concentration), share of markets in total exports of Ecuador(Market Concentration) and diversification and concentration of products in exports of Ecuador( Export Diversification and Herfindahl-Hirchman indices). The study will further suggest measures to develop trade relations with India by examining the trade statistics and indices for India and Ecuador. The study will Use World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) for the above analysis. WITS gives 2 digit, 4 digits and 6 digit disaggregated trade and tariff data from Commodity trade statistics of the UN and UNCTAD TRAINS data base. 2.	 Use SMART analysis (within WITS) to do simulations for trade liberalization effects for specialized and CSG products of Ecuador with MERCOSUR countries and the US, China, Japan and the EU27. Examine and analyze the trade creation, trade diversion, total trade effects along with revenue, welfare and consumer surplus effects of tariff liberalization for defining policy on the differential gains of such trade and tariff liberalization efforts with host of other trading partners/ regional trading partners of Ecuador mentioned above. 3.	 Use Gravity analysis to explain Ecuadorian trade of specialized and CSG products by identifying the host of determinants explaining such trade. These factors may include absolute size in terms of GDP of the trading partners; inter country dispersion of incomes, trade costs, prices of products prevailing in the two trading partners, dummies for common border, common trading arrangement, common language and common colony, among others. Use Gravity model to work out ‘export potential’ of Ecuador and its trading partners for CSG and specialized products The book will be divided into three main chapters based on three main specific objectives. These will be (a) Use of Trade Indices to Understand Trade Relations of Ecuador for Climate Smart Goods, Total Trade and Specialized Products. The second chapter will be (b) Trade Liberalization of CSG and Other Specialized Products: Comparative Analysis Using SMART (c) Export Potential and Basis of Trade of Climate Smart Goods and Specialized Products of Ecuador Using Gravity Analysis. The research study besides these three main chapters will have sections on the identified research problem, Definition of Research, Justification of taking up such study, Limitations, General and Specific Objectives, Environmental Sustainability in Ecuador, Conclusions and Policy Recommendations, Future Research and the Experience Gained. The justification of taking up such research is to (a) develop capabilities to create products friendly to the environment and other products for diversification of economy at the country and at the regional level. (b)Mapping the capabilities of trade to environmentally friendly countries and working out the export potential of Ecuador in CSG and Specialized Products at different levels of disaggregation (c)Establishment of regional indicators and indices related to export and import of CSG and total trade, competitiveness, comparative advantage and export specialization indices, among others, for specialized goods and CSG alike (d)Definition of CSG-commerce capabilities at Country, Regional and its sub-regional level, (e) Learning of new developments in the field of Gravity Analysis including literature on linking volume of trade with equality of incomes across countries (f) Proposal for designing economic policy to boost competitiveness, trade patterns, and changes by development of trade relations, economic growth and environmental stewardship through the implementation of policies, for which it seeks to develop capabilities to create products friendly to the environment, or CSG, at country and at the regional level of the MERCOSUR and ANDEAN member countries.(g) Enhance the skills of negotiators in understanding the relative benefits of trade liberalization with host of countries and regions by working on trade software WITS (h) Identifying Policies at the National and International Level for enhancing production of CSG goods.(k) The research work will be useful for all policy makers and negotiators designing and evaluating economic agreements, students, teachers and researchers in the field of international trade and environmental economics

Trade in Climate Smart Goods The following are some of the main conclusions of the research study.

Introduction

Trade Indices research indicates the factual position of country. The following can be derived from the research Ecuador needs to rethink its trade policy by diversifying its trade into manufactured products and more diversified production structure. Information Technology services, Tourism, Manufacturing of Automobiles, Education and Training Services, Bio combustibles, Housing materials, Pharmaceutical industries, Health Products and Hospital services, Hardware production, Industrial and Textile Goods and Chemicals are some areas where Ecuador can think of developing niche in the coming future and cater to European markets. Production and Trade in Climate Smart Goods is another area of focus. In particular, the study identifies the following industries for further diversifying industrial structure of Ecuador for its gain in future. These are Industrial Codes- 61(Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted), 62(Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, not knitted or crocheted),42( Articles of leather; saddlery and harness; travel goods, handbags and similar containers; articles of animal), 90(Optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments and apparatus; parts and accessories thereof), 84(Electronic appliances), 85(Electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof; sound recorders and reproducers, television image and sound recorders and reproducers, and parts and accessories of such articles),87 (Vehicles other than railway or tramway rollingstock, and parts and accessories thereof), 83 (Miscellaneous articles of base metal), 73 (Articles of iron or Steel), 69 (Ceramic products), 30 (Pharmaceutical products),29(Organic chemicals), Climate Smart Goods- 840510(Clean Coal Technologies), 850720,853710 and 854140(Solar Photovoltaic systems), 848340 and 848360( Wind Power Technologies), 853931(Energy Efficient Lighting), among others. In services sector, Tourism, IT and ITES, Hospital services, Education and Training Services( training of English), Cultural Services, Knowledge Processing Outsourcing and Financial Analytics, Infrastructure services have lot of potential of bring the necessary foreign exchange and stability into the system .Ecuador need to diversify into the following industries and services for higher and more stable export earnings, job creation and learning effects, and the development of new skills and infrastructure that would facilitate the development of even newer export products. SMART Analysis results shows that It is beneficial to trade in 20(2digit level) and 238 products(at 6 digit level) with the MERCOSUR trading partners while for trade in CSG it is better to liberalize trade with the Japan, the US and the China, the main suppliers (exporters)of CSG products. Gravity Analysis has been used in this study to explain the basis of trade of CSG goods of Ecuador and Trade of 20(at 2 Digit level) specialized products in 2010. Further, the variant of the Baier and Bergstrand (2001) gravity model has been used to work out the export potential of CSG and specialized products to and from Ecuador. The theoretical justification of extending the most simple Gravity model, as used in this study, is done using extensions of the work done by Helpman and Krugman (1985). The Export potential of Ecuador is worth 34.79 million US $ with the four Latin American countries (Bolivia, Chile, Columbia, and Peru in CSG products). However, SMART analysis had shown that for Ecuador it is better to liberalize trade of CSG products with the Japan, US and the China for overall gains.

Introduction

Source: WITS data base. 64 goods CSG list is based on HS 2002 but 2010 data.

After carefully looking at the figures for Ecuador one finds that Ecuador has a positive trade balance for CSG with the other ANDEAN and MERCOSUR countries. One would have least expected the same after finding that Ecuador is a net importer of Climate Smart Goods( basically components to cleaner technologies ) from China, Japan, the US ,the EU27 and World at large. Then why would it have a positive trade balance with its Latin American Trading Partners? Does this reflect the matured response of Ecuador on having growth with environment policies since early 1980s, reflected by its early ratification of Kyoto Protocol, CBT and protection of its Amazon jungles? Would it also mean that that Ecuador has realized the benefits of CSG goods early to have positive trade balance with its neighbouring countries? .We will outline the national and international policies adopted by Ecuador as far as cleaner and environment friendly policies are concerned to answer the above. Would it mean then that by further liberalizing trade by MERCOSUR and ANDEAN Countries including Ecuador and other Latin American Countries would bring some further gains to Ecuador5? Would Ecuador gain more by liberalizing Ecuador’s trade with the suppliers of the CSG- the Japan, the Hong Kong, China, EU and the US. One needs to do simulations with SMART analysis (within WITS) to answer the same (second part of study). Would it further mean that Ecuador will have the same trend (positive trade balance) with all its Latin American in all other products and some identified specialized products? If yes will it be beneficial to liberalize its trade with MERCOSUR or countries like the Japan, the US, China, and the Hong Kong for other products than CSG. The last two questions will entail use of various trade indices to identify the integration of Ecuador with the outside world and also help in identifying specialized products for Ecuador along with its markets. In particular, the above indices will help us to examine the role of international trade of Ecuador over the years(Export share in World Exports) and have comparative analysis with other nations and regional groups over the years, identify the specialized products of Ecuador and their markets over the years by examining the changing comparative advantage in production of some products (RCA and Export Specialization Indices), also identify the extent of matching of Ecuadorian products with its trading partners(Trade Complementarity index), its intensity of trade relations with its trading partners (Trade Intensity Index) , share of specialized and CSG products in exports of Ecuador(Product Concentration), share of markets in total exports of Ecuador(Market Concentration) and diversification and concentration of products in exports of Ecuador( Export Diversification and Herfindahl-Hirchman indices).Continuing, the study will suggest measures to develop trade relations with India by examining the trade statistics
5	 Liberalizing trade in this study would mean a scenario of zero tariffs for imported products. This would have total trade effects as sum of price or terms of trade effect and quantity effects as sum of trade creation and trade diversion effects. These effects along with consumer surplus, revenue effects and welfare effects will accrue to the importer. Such effects are estimated by SMART (partial analysis). In addition, the export potential of exporters is also worked out. In this study we have done liberalization simulation for Ecuador (importer) country only. Therefore, any export potential effects of Ecuador for imports coming into MERCOSUR or EU, the Japan, The China and the US is examined by not working on the liberalization efforts of its trading partners but by Gravity Analysis (Third Objective). Liberalization in general would mean that zero tariffs for products emanating out of the importing country into the partner country and zero tariffs for products coming into importing country from partner country. Multilateral liberalization will always bring larger welfare than regional liberalization. The study discusses the various strategies related to regional liberalization as global trade talks are not succeeding as expected.

and indices for India and Ecuador. Thereafter, SMART analysis will be done to make judgments of liberalizing trade of specialized products with MERCOSUR and the developed nations. At the end Gravity Analysis is done to explain Ecuadorian trade of specialized and CSG products by identifying the host of determinants explaining such trade. The study uses Gravity model to work out export potential of Ecuador and its trading partners for CSG and specialized products. The study will be divided into three main chapters, based on three main specific objectives. These will be (a) Use of Trade Indices to Understand Trade Relations of Ecuador for Climate Smart Goods, Total Trade and Specialized Products. The second chapter will be (b) Trade Liberalization of CSG and Other Specialized Products: Comparative Analysis Using SMART (c) Export Potential and Basis of Trade of Climate Smart Goods and Specialized Products of Ecuador Using Gravity Analysis. The research study besides these three main chapters will have sections on Background and Importance of the Climate Smart Goods, sections on Definition of Research, Justification of taking up such study, Limitations, General and Specific Objectives, Conclusions and Policy Recommendations, Future Research and the Experience Gained.

Background and Importance of the Climate Smart Goods
The CSG forms part of the broader group named ‘environmental goods and services (EGS). The Environmental goods and services industry consists of activities which produce goods and services to measure, prevent, limit, minimize or correct environmental damage to water, air and soil, as well as problems related to waste, noise and eco systems. This includes cleaner technologies, products and services which reduce environmental risk and minimize pollution and resource use. An Environmental good can be understood as equipment, material or technology used to address a particular environmental problem or as a product that is itself ‘environmentally preferable’ to other similar products because of its relatively benign

Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Introduction

impact on environment. Environmental services are services provided by eco systems or human activities to address environmental problems. EGS can be also classified as Environmental Goods comprising of pollution management products, cleaner technologies and products, resource management products and environmentally preferable products. EGS also has Environmental services comprising of sewage services, refuse services, sanitation and similar services and others. The EGS were first discussed as part of the liberalizing agenda in the DOHA round of the multilateral trading round in 2001. The countries had wanted the tariff and non-tariff barriers to go down for trade of such EGS as this may lead to adoption of cleaner and cost effective technologies by firms and country at large and possibly mitigate climate change and improve energy efficiency. Liberalization has followed three routes namely the list approach, project/integrated approach and request for offer approach. Environmental Goods were always part of trade agenda but were subsumed within industrial or agricultural negotiations. CSGs constitute low carbon technologies such as solar photovoltaic systems (Industry Codes 850720, 853710, 854140), wind power generation (industry codes 848340 and 848360), clean coal technologies (840510) and energy-efficient lighting (853931)6, among others. Trade and investment in CSGs and climate-smart services have recently received much attention as a triple win scenario where trade, climate and environment, and development all benefit (UNESCAP, 2011,a,b). Climate Smart Goods and technologies allows for production processes that have no or minimum Green House Gas(GHG) emissions and negative impact on environment and which are atleast economically efficient and acceptable. Climate Smart Technologies consists of technology that improve efficiency and conservation of conventional fossil energy and enable the commercial and efficient use of renewable energy sources. Promoting CSG trade has become important because of the need of such goods by countries in the wake of recent financial crisis in Europe and after events in Japan recently. Countries want to concentrate on low energy consumption and save themselves from relying entirely on nuclear energy which may be prone and be affected by natural disasters like what happened in Japan. Our Gravity analysis has shown that there is potential for trade in CSG by Ecuador and trading nations alike. Countries need to design sustainable and climate smart growth that entails sharply reduced GHG emissions to a level of 450 ppm( or may be lower) and that limits the global temperature rise to not more than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The study below lists such policies and is not confined to trade policies alone. Trade policies related to CSG though are the main

Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Introduction

focus of this study. The entire set of policies which can reduce GHG emissions and limit climate change can be structured into regulatory measures( including regulations, standards and labeling), economic incentives( including taxes, tradable permits and subsidies conforming to WTO laws and provisions), trade and investment policies and financial, energy and enterprise development policies, among others. Appendix Table XII lists the various efforts made by international community to tackle the Climate Change. These include the Rio Meet in 1992,Kyoto Protocol of 1997, Copenhagen accord in 2009, the COP 16 meeting, the Bali Action Plan of 2007 and the very ambitious, the Durban meeting of 2011. These meetings are besides the DOHA agenda on liberalizing trade in environmental goods and services. This study believes that economic growth, higher trade and environment sustainability, all three are possible at the same time and there is limited trade off between them. The debate on trade, growth and environment sustainability have arisen as trade and environment sustainability are not always positively related. Grossman and Krueger(1994) argues that trade affects environment through scale effects, technique effect and composition effect. With the rapid increase of trade and investment in recent decades as a result of sustained liberalization, the ecological footprint – including GHG emissions – has also risen sharply. This is called the “scale effect”. When renewable energy replaces traditional fossil fuels, trade and investment are no longer associated with Green House Gas(GHG) emissions. Instead trade and investment become principal components of efforts to mitigate climate change. The other two identified effects are the composition and technique effects. The composition effect refers to the way trade liberalization changes countries’ comparative advantages towards emissionintensive or emission-friendly industries. For example, a changing comparative advantage as a result of trade liberalization may lead carbon-intensive industries to relocate from countries with strict regulations to countries (often developing countries) with less stringent regulations, which are known as “pollution havens” (and, thus, provide a large comparative advantage), leading to “carbon leakage”. The net global composition effect of trade opening on GHG emissions is therefore not necessarily positive. The technique effect refers to the manner in which technological improvements may be adopted to increase production efficiency and reduce emission intensity as a result of trade and trade liberalization. This may happen in two ways: (a) trade liberalization increases the availability of climate-smart technology; and (b) trade income increases incomes and wealth – people with more wealth tend to be more concerned about other aspects of well-being, including a clean environment (Grossmann and Krueger, 1994). The value of World CSG exports were worth 410 billion US $ in 2008. Ecuador’s export share in World exports of CSG has remained less than 0.02 % in 2002 through 2010. The Leading Exporters Japan, US, Countries in the EU, China and Hong Kong´s export share is more than 3 % in World Exports of CSG. World Trade Organization (WTO) has recognized 153 environmental goods which have been broadly classified under the following headings: •	 Air pollution control •	 Management of solid and hazardous waste and recycling systems •	 Clean up or remediation of soil and water •	 Renewable energy plants •	 Heat and energy management •	 Waste water management and potable water treatment •	 Environmentally preferable products (based on end use or disposal charactersitics) •	 Natural risks management •	 Natural resources protection •	 Noise and vibration abatement World Bank has identified 43 products out of the ‘153’ products list proposed by proponents of Environmental Goods liberalization in the WTO. These 43 products comprise diverse products from wind turbines to solar panels to water saving 14

Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Introduction

shower. Also there has been a rapid growth in their imports and exports. What is common in all the lists floating around is that they consist of goods which tend to have benign impact on environment and lead to low carbon emanating processes. Trade and investment in CSG offers opportunities to export international standards, promote the rule of law and good governance, and close the gap between the rich and poor. Trade in CSG will help Ecuador to promote alternative industries in the face of Global Economic Downturn. Also, it will help country to look for safe, alternative and reliable energy source rather than believing in trade of crude and Petroleum Oil only or investing a great deal in nuclear energy. Nuclear energy was in the brink of being affected in Japan due to recent Earthquake in Japan. Ecuador can direct its social spending in promoting small industries which can provide CSG goods at low cost. Countries can gain in terms of their comparative advantage and establish new industries. Positions keep changing in terms of the advantage of producing goods and services. Based on our analysis and review of studies done on CSG(UNESCAP,2011,a,b, ICTSD, WTO and World Bank) one may conclude that various national and international policies can be followed by Ecuador and its trading partners to promote trade of CSG goods for increasing welfare, diversification and promoting alternative sources of energy .

Definition of Research:
a)	 The Research will focus on Ecuadorian Trade Relations in CSG and Other Specialized Products and its liberalization efforts with all its trading partners but focusing more on MERCOSUR and ANDEAN Community, India, EU27, China, Japan and the US b)	 The time period for research is 2002 through 2010. SMART and Gravity analysis is done for 2010. c)	 Trade and Tariff Data will come from the WITS data base. SMART analysis is in WITS. The url is http:// wits.worldbank.org/wits/ d)	 Gravity analysis for working out the basis of trade of CSG and specialized products. The data will come from various sources. Import data to and from Ecuador of CSG goods-one category made of the list of 64 goods (under 6 Digit HS Combined) is taken from WITS data base for 2010 GDP data of trading partners is expressed in billions of US dollars and the basic source of data is the IMF, World Economic Outlook (April 2011 edition) Distance data is taken from the dist_cepii.xls file of CEPII data base (www.cepii.fr) Tariff data is applied weighted tariff (%) on CSG goods for each country available from the TRAINS data (within WITS data base) Intercountry dispersion is product of two terms si *sj where si=GDPi/(GDPi+GDPj) and sj=GDPj/(GDPi+GDPj). Si and Sj are constructed from GDP data of trading partners. The product has an inverse relationship with variance of country’s share of income in total group income. Variance of country’s share of income in total group income is inversely related to volume of trade between countries Prices data of reporter (importer) and partner (exporter) from the GDP deflators available from the World Bank World Development Indicators available at the World Bank website for 2010(Index Numbers)

I	 Use of Trade Indices to Understand Trade Relations of Ecuador for Climate Smart Goods, Total Trade and Specialized Products
The following trade indices (along with their definition) have been used in this study for objective analysis of Ecuador’s trade relations with its trading partners. •	 Country’s Share of World Exports It is the share of a country’s total exports in the world’s total exports. This ratio can be used to assess changing world market share of a country over time. •	 Share of Product in Total Exports It is the share of each export product (at a chosen level of disaggregation) in the country’s total exports. •	 Share of Market in Total Exports It is the share of exports sold in each foreign country in the home country’s total exports.

•	 Hirschman Herfindahl Index It is the sum of squared shares of each product in total export. A country with a perfectly diversified export portfolio will have an index close to zero, whereas a country which exports only one export will have a value of 1 (least diversified). •	 Revealed Comparative Advantage Index Measures of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) have been used to help assess a country’s export potential. The RCA indicates whether a country is in the process of extending the products in which it has a trade potential, as opposed to situations in which the number of products that can be competitively exported is static. It can also provide useful information about potential trade prospects with new partners. Countries with similar RCA profiles are unlikely to have high bilateral trade intensities unless intra-industry trade is involved. RCA measures, if estimated at high levels of product disaggregation, can focus attention on other nontraditional products that might be successfully exported. The RCA index of country I for product j is often measured by the product’s share in the country’s exports in relation to its share in world trade: RCAij = (xij/Xit) / (xwj/Xwt) Where xij and xwj are the values of country i’s exports of product j and world exports of product j and where Xit and Xwt refer to the country’s total exports and world total exports. A value of less than unity implies that the country has a revealed comparative disadvantage in the product. Similarly, if the index exceeds unity, the country is said to have a revealed comparative advantage in the product. country’s exports. •	 Trade IntensityIndex The trade intensity index (T) is used to determine whether the value of trade between two countries is greater or smaller than would be expected on the basis of their importance in world trade. It is defined as the share of one country’s exports going to a partner divided by the share of world exports going to the partner. It is calculated as: Tij = (xij/Xit)/(xwj/Xwt) Where xij and xwj are the values of country i’s exports and of world exports to country j and where Xit and Xwt are country i’s total exports and total world exports respectively. An index of more (less) than one indicates a bilateral trade flow that is larger (smaller) than expected, given the partner country’s importance in world trade. •	 Trade ComplementarityIndex The trade complementarity (TC) index can provide useful information on prospects for intraregional trade in that it shows how well the structures of a country’s imports and exports match. It also has the attraction that its values for countries considering the formation of a regional trade agreement can be compared with others that have formed or tried to form similar arrangements. The TC between countries k and j is defined as: TCkj = 100(1 – sum(|mik – xij| / 2)) Where xij is the share of good i in global exports of country j and mik is the share of good i in all imports of country k . The index is zero when no goods are exported by one country or imported by the other and 100 when the export and import shares exactly match.

•	 Export Diversification (or Concentration) Index Export diversification is held to be important for developing countries because many developing countries are often highly dependent on relatively few primary commodities for their export earnings. Unstable prices for these commodities may subject a developing country exporter to serious terms of trade shocks. Since the covariation in individual commodity prices is less than perfect, diversification into new primary export products is generally viewed as a positive development. The strongest positive effects are normally associated with diversification into manufactured goods, and its benefits include higher and more stable export earnings, job creation and learning effects, and the development of new skills and infrastructure that would facilitate the development of even newer export products. The export diversification (DX) index for a country is defined as: DXj = (sum |hij – xi|) / 2 Where hij is the share of commodity i in the total exports of country j and xi is the share of the commodity in world exports. The related measure used by UNCTAD is the concentration index or Hirschman (H) index, which is calculated using the shares of all three-digit products in a country’s exports: Hj = sqrt [ sum (xi/Xt)2]Where xi is country j’s exports of product i (at the three-digit classification) and Xt is country j’s total exports. The index has been normalized to account for the number of actual three-digit products that could be exported. Thus, the maximum value of the index is 239 (the number of individual three-digit products in SITC revision 2), and its minimum (theoretical) value is zero, for a country with no exports. The lower the index, the less concentrated are a country’s exports. •	 Export Specialization Index The export specialization (ES) index is a slightly modified RCA index, in which the denominator is usually measured by specific markets or partners. It provides product information on revealed specialization in the export sector of a country and is calculated as the ratio of the share of a product in a country’s total exports to the share of this product in imports to specific markets or partners rather than its share in world exports: ES = (xij/Xit) / (mkj/Mkt) Where xij and Xit are export values of country i in product j, respectively, and where mkj and Mkt are the import values of product j in market k and total imports in market k. The ES is similar to the RCA in that the value of the index less than unity indicates a comparative disadvantage and a value greater than one indicates advantage of producing and exporting into the identified markets.

I.I	 Revealed Comparative Advantage, Export Specialization Index and Product Concentration of Climate Smart Goods in Ecuadorian Exports: A Comparative Analysis with India
The Table II reveals that there are two products in which Ecuador has a comparative advantage in production in 2010. These two industrial codes have RCA>1 in 2010 and hence Ecuador has a comparative advantage in the production of such products. These products are

The Export Specialization index helps us to identify markets for the CSG products in which Ecuador has a comparative advantage. Table III identifies the markets for two of the CSG products in which Ecuador has an advantage in production. They are Chile, Columbia and Peru in 2010.The export specialization (ES) index is a slightly modified RCA index, in which the denominator is usually measured by specific markets or partners. It provides product information on revealed specialization in the export sector of a country and is calculated as the ratio of the share of a product in a country’s total exports to the share of this product in imports to specific markets or partners. A Value greater than one indicates advantage of producing and exporting into the identified markets.

Trade Indices to Understand Ecuador’s Integration to World Markets:

We work out export share of Ecuador’s total Exports in World Exports from 2002 through 2010. Table VII shows the export share in percentage terms for Ecuador. It has increased from mere 0.0867 % in 2002 to 0.12% in 2010. The positive trend is a healthy sign but is too low to have its substantial presence in the international markets.

China’s export share has increased over the years and it has reached to 10.97 % in 2010. EU, Japan and the US share’s are respectively 11.92%, 5.08% and 8.09% in 2010. It is to be observed that the share of the developed nations is going down from what it were in 2002 to what it is in 2010 while for most of the developing nations including the Latin American countries, the share although not much is moving up(see Table IX below). China´s share has increased at a much faster pace than some of its counterparts (see Table IX below). Mexico share has marginally declined from what it were in 2002 to 2.06% in 2010.

It seems that industry code 56(Wadding, Filtered and Non-Woven Yarns) and 59(Impregnated, Coated, Covered, Laminated Textile Fabrics) are added in 2010 while industry code 24(Tobacco and Manufactured Tobacco Substitutes), 69(Ceramic Products), 58(Special Woven Fabrics and Tufted Textile Fabrics) and 12(Oilseeds, Olage, Fruit) were not present in 2010 list. There were 18 industries in which Ecuador had an advantage in 2002, 17 in 2005 and 20 in 2010. There is not much substantial observational shift of comparative advantage from 2002 through 2010. RCA is worked for industries disaggregated at 6 digit levels. Appendix Table IV and V lists 213 and 238 industries out of more than 5300 industries in which Ecuador has comparative advantage for production of industries disaggregated at 6 digit level in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Appendix Table XI lists the products in which Ecuador has advantage at 6 digit disaggregated level. For the complete list of more than 5300 industries disaggregated one would need to log on to the WITS. It is also available with author on demand. Table XIV gives the RCA figures for 20 specialized industries in all years from 2002 through 2010. All industries except industries, 23(Residues and Waste from Food Industries), 24(Tobacco and Manufactured Tobacco Substitutes), 58(Special Woven Fabrics, tufted textile fabrics, lace, tapestries, trimmings, embroidery, 65(Headgears and Parts thereof)

and 78 (Lead and articles thereof) show uniform advantage in all years from 2002 through 2010. The figures show that Ecuador gained advantage in industry code 78 in 2009. Before that year, the value of RCA for industry code 78 was less than one. For industry code 58 one can see that RCA has been greater than one in 2008 and 2009 only. One may conclude that for all other industries, 23, 24 and 65, Ecuador has in some years lost its comparative advantage while in some other years it has gained advantage. Ecuador needs to focus attention on such industries so that they remain in advantage permanently. The study identifies the following industries for further diversifying industrial structure of Ecuador for its gain in future. These are Industrial Codes- 61(Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted), 62(Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, not knitted or crocheted),42( Articles of leather; saddlery and harness; travel goods, handbags and similar containers; articles of animal), 90(Optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments and apparatus; parts and accessories thereof), 84(Electronic appliances), 85(Electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof; sound recorders and reproducers, television image and sound recorders and reproducers, and parts and accessories of such articles),87 (Vehicles other than railway or tramway rolling-stock, and parts and accessories thereof), 83 (Miscellaneous articles of base metal), 73 (Articles of iron or Steel), 69 (Ceramic products), 30 (Pharmaceutical products),29(Organic chemicals), Climate Smart Goods- 840510(Clean Coal Technologies), 850720,853710 and 854140(Solar Photovoltaic systems), 848340 and 848360( Wind Power Technologies), 853931(Energy Efficient Lighting), among others. In services sector, Tourism, IT and ITES, Hospital services, Education and Training Services( training of English), Cultural Services, Knowledge Processing Outsourcing and Financial Analytics, Infrastructure services have lot of potential of bring the necessary foreign exchange and stability into the system .Ecuador need to diversify into the following industries and services for higher and more stable export earnings, job creation and learning effects, and the development of new skills and infrastructure that would facilitate the development of even newer export products.

Source: Author´s work on WITS. 20 specialized products can be identified from the Appendix List II below or Table XII above.

The table indicates that Ecuador is targeting the US markets in 2010 for exports of Fish, Cut Flowers and Live Trees, Edible Fruits, Preparation of Meat and Fish, Cocoa and Cocoa Preparations and Mineral fuels and products from distilleries, Japan and the United Kingdom for Other Vegetable Textile Fibres, Chile for Fish, Fruits and Live trees and Cut flowers, Germany and Italy for Edible Fruits and Nuts, Spain for Preparation of Meat and Fish, Brazil for Preparation of Meat and Fish and Sugar and Sugar Confectionaries, Italy for Vegetable Plaiting Material and for Preparation of Meat and Fish, Columbia and Venezuela for Preparation of Meat and Fish, Canada for Live trees, Bulb root and Cut flowers, Mexico for Cocoa and Cocoa Preparations, among others. Since 2002, Ecuador has probably lost its competitiveness since 2002 in providing Cocoa and Cocoa Preparations and Preparation of Vegetables and Fruits in the US Markets. Table XVII given below gives the Trade Complementarity Index for Ecuador based on trade data available at 6 digit disaggregated levels for years 2002, 2005, 2009 and 2010. The index shows how well the structures of a country’s imports and exports match. The index is zero when no goods are exported by one country or imported by the other and 100 when the export and import shares exactly match. It is observed that Lao PDR has the highest value of the index for years 2002(61.01), 2009(56.45) and 2010(54.01). Bolivia has the highest value in 2005(56.45). Hence, it seems that both these countries, among all, have the matching of their products with Ecuador. In 2009, Columbia stood second(47.28) after Lao followed by East Asian Country Cambodia, followed by Bolivia, Malta, Lithuania, Netherlands, Italy, India and then Chile. In 2010, Lao tops the list followed by Cyprus, Slovenia, Estonia, Argentina, Paraguay, Cambodia, Netherlands, India, Bulgaria, Finland, Italy and Peru. Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Venezuela and Colombia figure up in top 15 countries on the list based on decreasing value of the index in at least one of the years- 2002,2005,2009 and 2010. Also, one finds that except for few countries the position of trading partners in terms of the indices is not fixed. There may be a case for aligning Ecuador with the Baltics in Europe and some it’s trading partners like Netherlands, Denmark, Spain and Italy and/ Or some of the East Asian Nations like Lao and Cambodia or with the Medditarrean Countries like Malta and Cyprus. In Latin America, Ecuador may have bilateral and regional economic agreements with Bolivia, Peru, Columbia and Chile. The negotiations are generally done at 6 Digit level. One can always work out the Trade Complementarity Index at 2 digit levels which may show entirely different trading partners which have matching of products with Ecuador.

Use of Trade Indices to Understand ...

Table XVIII gives the Trade Intensity Index for Ecuador in 2002, 2005 and 2010.An index of more (less) than one indicates a bilateral trade flow that is larger (smaller) than expected, given the partner country’s importance in world trade. We find that in year 2010, Peru, Venezuela, United States, Uruguay, Bolivia, Columbia, Chile, Argentina, Italy and Spain, all had intense trade relations with Ecuador. All other countries listed in 2010 have potential to increase trade relations with Ecuador (have values of index less than one). To name few are Japan, Malaysia, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Mexico, Germany, among others. The list of 2010 is common with other years except one finds that Ecuador does not have intense trade relations with Brazil in 2010. Ecuador may need to rethink their trade policies with the fast growing Brazil and South Korea.

Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Use of Trade Indices to Understand ...

The export diversification (DX) index for a country is defined as: DXj = (sum |hij – xi|) / 2 Where hij is the share of commodity i in the total exports of country j and xi is the share of the commodity in world exports.The lower the index, the less concentrated are a country’s exports. Table XVIX gives the Export Diversification index for Ecuador based on trade data disaggregated at 2 Digit and 6 Digit levels. The figures are on the higher side indicating the concentrated trade of Ecuador. Product concentration index below will confirm that more than half of Ecuador´s exports are of Industry 27(Mineral Fuel and Products from the Distillery). Ecuador needs to rethink its trade policy by diversifying its trade into manufactured products and more diversified production structure. Information Technology services, Tourism, Manufacturing of Automobiles, Industrial and Textile Goods and Chemicals are some areas where Ecuador can think of developing niche and cater to European markets. Production and Trade in Climate Smart Goods is another area of focus.

Table XVIX and Table XX shows some conflicting trends for Ecuador from 2002 till 2010. While at 2 digit level the Export Diversification index shows that exports are becoming more diversified, but at the 6 digit disaggregation the index indicates that Ecuador trade is becoming more concentrated. Whatever it may be the tariff liberalization at the international level are done at 6 digit levels. Ecuador needs to keep focusing on diversifying its production and trade structure.

The table XXI below shows the Herfindahl-Hirchman Index (HH) of Trade Concentration. A country with a perfectly diversified export portfolio will have an index close to zero, whereas a country which exports only one export will have a value of 1 (least diversified). The HH index of Ecuador shows that Ecuador´s economy has become less diversified in 2010 from what it was in 2002. In general Latin American countries need to focus on diversifying their production and trade structure.

The Table XXII confirms the results of the earlier mentioned two tables. In 2010, more than 55% of Ecuador´s total exports are of Industrial Code 27(Mineral fuels, oils & product of their distilleries), followed by industrial code, 08(Edible fruit and nuts) covering more than 12% of Ecuadorian exports, followed by 03(Fish & crustacean, mollusc & other aquatic invertebrates (covering more than 6% of Ecuador´s exports), followed by Industrial code 06 (Live trees and other plants; bulbs, roots and the like; cut flowers and ornamental foliage) covering 3.49%, Preparations of meat, of fish or of crustaceans, mollusks or other aquatic invertebrates (chapter 16) covering 3.42 %, Cocoa and cocoa preparations (chapter 18) covering 2.41 %, Preparations of vegetables, fruit, nuts or other parts of plants (chapter 20) covering 1.38% in 2010,among others. The trade concentration of Industrial code 27 has increased from more than 40% in 2002 to more than 55% in 2010. The share of industrial code 03 has come down marginally in 2010 from what it were in 2002. The share of industrial code 08(Edible fruits and nuts) has come down from more than 20% in 2002 to more than 12 % in 2010. The share of industrial code 06 has come down from more than 5 % in 2002 to less than 3.50% in 2010. These trend may also indicate the importance of petroleum oil and other services industry (Travel and Tourism, Information Technology, Infrastructure services, among others) in production and trade structure of Ecuador.

Conclusions from Trade Indices Work
Ecuador need to rethink its trade policy by diversifying its trade into manufactured products and more diversified production structure. Information Technology services, Tourism, Manufacturing of Automobiles, Education and Training Services, Bio combustibles, Housing materials, Pharmaceutical industries, Health Products and Hospital services, Hardware production, Industrial and Textile Goods, Industrial and Textile Goods and Chemicals are some areas where Ecuador can think of developing niche and cater to European markets. Production and Trade in Climate Smart Goods is another area of focus. In particular, study identifies the following industries for further diversifying industrial structure of Ecuador for its gain in future. These are Industrial Codes- 61(Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted), 62(Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, not knitted or crocheted),42( Articles of leather; saddlery and harness; travel goods, handbags and similar containers; articles of animal), 90(Optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking,

II	 Trade Liberalization of CSG and Other Specialized Products: Comparative Analysis Using SMART
II.I	 Simulations Done Using Smart Analysis (Within Wits) For Working Out The Liberalization Impact Of Csg Trade Of Ecuador With Mercosur And China, Japan, Us And Eu In 2010
The study uses SMART- Single Market Partial Equilibrium Simulation Tool (available within WITS Database) to understand the liberalization effects of tariffs (zero tariffs) on the importer.

Rationale for Market Access Analysis
Despite successive rounds of multilateral, regional and unilateral trade liberalization, some trade barriers (including tariffs) remain highly restrictive in many (both developed and developing) countries. For any government, it is crucial to be able to assess or to pre-empt the impact of different trade policy options. Market access analysis is a useful tool that can be used to anticipate the likely economic effects of various policy alternatives. Impact of domestic trade reforms. For political economy or social purposes, it is often important to determine the distribution of the potential gains and losses from any contemplated policy changes. This will assist in anticipating any adjustment costs associated with reform implementation. Impact of foreign trade liberalization. For instance, when preparing for trade negotiations, market access analysis helps identify the sensitive sectors where negotiating efforts should be focused. Also, it could be useful in the formation of negotiating coalitions in multilateral/regional negotiations. The market access analysis tool included in the WITS package allows the researcher to investigate the impact of unilateral/ preferential/multilateral trade reforms at home or abroad on various variables including: Trade flows (import, exports, trade creation and trade diversion), world prices, tariff revenue and economic welfare. The total trade effects are worked out by adding up the price effects (terms of trade effect) and quantity effects of trade by adding the trade creation and trade diversion effects. In addition the total welfare effect, consumer surplus effect and revenue effects of tariff reduction is also worked out. For understanding the impact of tariff cuts, we discuss the opposite scenario of the impact on the economy if tariffs are imposed by the ´Small Country´ and another by one ´Large Country´. Small Country Case: A Country is small enough to have any impact on terms of trade. 48

The tariff increases the price from P W to P W + t in the figure below. As a result, consumer surplus falls by (a + b + c + d). Producer surplus rises by area a, and government revenue increases by the area c. Therefore, the net loss in welfare, the deadweight loss to Home, is (b + d), which is measured by the two triangles b and d in figure below. Overall Effect of the Tariff on Welfare The overall impact of the tariff in the small country can be summarized as follows: Fall in consumer surplus		 Rise in producer surplus		 Rise in government revenue	 Net effect on Home welfare	 -(a+b+c+d) +a +c -(b+d)

Therefore, any reductions in tariffs for small country will reduce production and consumption distortions. It would mean that consumer surplus will increase, producer surplus will decrease and welfare will improve of the small economy. Large Country Case (see figure below): The Country is large enough to have impact on prices (terms of trade). The terms of trade improves for the tariff imposing country. The net effect on the welfare of the importing country is ambiguous. Loss in consumer surplus-(A+B+C+D) Gain in Producer Surplus +A Government Revenue + C+E Net Effect of Tariff = E-(B+D) E is the terms of trade gain and B+D are the distortions in the economy. Hence, there are optimal tariffs which maximizes welfare (E-(B+D). The formula for the optimal tariff works out is the reciprocal of the elasticity of the foreign supply curve (upward sloping for large importing country). Reduction in tariffs for large country will effect terms of trade and reduction in distortions due to increase in consumer surplus and reduction in producer surplus and reduction in tariff revenue for the Government.

Trade Creation & Trade Diversion and Total Trade Effects in SMART (Quantity Effects of Tariff Liberalization)
The explanatory table below shows the cost to the United States of purchasing an automobile part from various source countries, with and without tariffs. The numbers illustrate the idea of trade diversion, under which the United States could switch from buying the auto part from Asia before NAFTA (for $20.90 with a 10% tariff) to Mexico after NAFTA (for $20 with zero tariff). While the United States gains 90¢ on each unit from paying a lower price, it also loses $1.90 in tariff revenue from not purchasing from Asia. An initial tariff of 20% going down to zero levels will show that trade is created with Mexico. Consumers gain in US because they are now getting cars from Mexico at US $ 20 and at the same time the Mexican Producers gain. Trade creation is always welfare improving while trade diversion most of times are welfare reducing (except when Mexicans can put extra effort in providing all the car requirements of the US).

Trade creation (in SMART model) is defined as the direct increase in imports following a reduction on the tariff imposed on good g from country c. If the tariff reduction on good g from country c is a preferential tariff reduction (i.e. it does not apply to other countries, c ), then imports of good g from country c are further going to increase due to the substitution away from imports of good g from other countries that becomes relatively more expensive. This is the definition of trade diversion in the SMART model. For exporting countries, total trade effect is made of trade diversion and trade creation. Equations for Trade Creation and Trade Diversion are given in Appendix Table VI. The values will depend on import demand elasticity, substitution elasticity and supply elasticity.

Simulation I: Liberalization of CSG Trade with MERCOSUR countries in 2010
The first simulation is the liberalization impacts of zero tariffs on imports of CSG from the rest of the nine MERCOSUR countries. The following are the outputs of the SMART analysis (within WITS). The Detailed Data report is to check the raw data used for smart simulation just to make sure the dataset corresponds to expectations. The Export View report shows the impact of the tariff reform on partner’s exports to the considered market. It displays the pre value of exports (before the tariff change), the post value of exports (after the tariff change) to the considered market as well as the net value between the two, considered as the change in exports revenue The Market View report returns all three types of effects affecting the market (trade value, tariff revenue and welfare change) by individual product code and for all products as one aggregate. The Revenue Impact report returns individual results on the market’s revenue by product code and for all products as one aggregate. The report displays the tariff revenue change between the pre and post tariff cut situation as well as the trade total effects. The Trade Creation Effect report returns individual results on Trade Total effect by product code/partner combination and for all products as one aggregate. This report also shows the trade diversion effect among partners and trade creation effect for both the market and its partners. In SMART, beneficiaries of the tariff reduction enjoy both positive diversion effect and positive creation effect while all other partners will suffer from negative diversion effect and no trade creation effect The Welfare Effect report returns individual results on the market’s welfare by product code and for all products as one aggregate. The report displays the Total Trade Effect, which is defined as the sum of Trade Diversion effect, Trade Creation Effect and Price Effect as well as the Welfare Effect defined as the benefits consumers in the importing country derive from the lower domestic prices after the removal or reduction of tariffs. In the SMART modeling framework, a change in trade policy (say preferential tariff liberalization) affects not only the price index/level of the composite good but also the relative prices of the different varieties. Despite the export supply elasticity,

the import demand elasticity and the substitution elasticity9, it will lead to changes in the chosen aggregate level of spending on that good as well as to changes in the composition of the sourcing of that good. Both channels affect bilateral trade flows. As mentioned above SMART reports the results of any trade policy shock on a number of variables. In particular, it reports the effects on trade flows (i.e. imports from the different sources). It also decomposes those trade effects in trade creation and trade diversion. Trade creation is defined as the direct increase in imports following a reduction on the tariff imposed on good g from country c. If the tariff reduction on good g from country c is a preferential tariff reduction (i.e. it does not apply to other countries, c ), then imports of good g from country c are further going to increase due to the substitution away from imports of good g from other countries that becomes relatively more expensive. This is the definition of trade diversion in the SMART model.
9	 Import Demand Elasticity: Values used by default in SMART have been empirically estimated for each country and every HS 6-digit product. For more details see Hiau Looi Kee& Alessandro Nicita& Marcelo Olarreaga, 2008. “Import Demand Elasticitiesand Trade Distortions,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, vol. 90(4), pages 666-682, 07. Substitution Elasticity: Is the substitution elasticity value between partners. Substitution elasticity entails a product by product simulation, which is based on the assumption that any product is independent of another product. SMART uses 1.5 as the default value. However, one can change this default value. It is recommended to keep it at 1.5 for industrial products but to increase it for primary goods. The reason being that the higher the substitution elasticity, the higher the substitutability of the same product from different suppliers. However, the more sophisticated a product is, the higher its rigidity of being substitutable. Supply Elasticity: Is the export supply elasticity value. By default, SMART uses 99 for an infinite elasticity for all products and partners. The reason being that we are dealing with a single-country simulation tool, so one country is too small compared to the rest of the world in order to have an impact on the price level. However, if you consider imports of a certain product from a bigger entity (like the European Union e.g.) to be relatively high and have a real impact on the world price level, you can lower the supply elasticity

We summarize the results in Tables I through III (Simulation I). Table I gives the total trade effect (sum of price-terms of trade effect, and quantity effects-trade creation and trade diversion effects) of tariff liberalization undertaken by Ecuador in context of MERCOSUR countries (simulations) in 2010. Price effects in these simulations are zero because we assume Ecuador to be the ‘small country’. Colombia gains the most in terms of total trade effects followed by Argentina and Peru. Chile has negative total trade effects because Chile already has a free trade policy with most of its Latin American Partners. Total trade effect for the US is negative and relatively higher as there is trade diversion from US to MERCOSUR countries for trade in CSG goods. For saving space the trade diversion impact on all countries is not shown. The total trade effect on the World is 3111.64 1000 US $.

SMART also calculates the impact of the trade policy change on tariff revenue, consumer surplus and welfare. A tariff revenue change on a given import flow is computed simply as the final Ad Valorem tariff multiplied by the final import value minus the initial Ad Valorem tariff multiplied by the initial import value.

Trade Liberalization of CSG and Other ...

1.	 A tariff revenue loss at constant import value, which corresponds to a transfer from the State

consumers and is equal to Q0*(t0-t1).

to

2.	 A tariff revenue gain through the increase in imports which enlarges the tax base and is equal

to (Q1-Q0)*t.

Using SMART internal import demand elasticity values, the tariff liberalization simulation returns a negative tariff revenue change (that is revenue gain from increased imports not enough to dominate revenue loss due to tariff decrease) in most cases. Table II below shows that the welfare effects of tariff liberalization for CSG products. This works out to be 351.76 1000 US $ while the total imports before tariff reduction is 252,746.147, 1000 US$. The revenue effect works out to be -2,276.697, 1000 US $. The total import change is 3111.634, 1000 US$ due to reduction in tariffs on imports of CSG from MERCOSUR.

Smart Analysis For Trade In Specialized Products Of Ecuador

The first simulations are about Liberalization of 20 Products (in which Ecuador had Comparative Advantage) with MERCOSUR countries in 2010. The Table X below shows the trade creation, trade diversion and total trade effect of reducing tariffs on 20 specialized products with MERCOSUR Countries only. The major gainers in Latin American region in terms of total trade effect are Peru (62,438.419, 1000 US$), followed by Columbia (28,396.772,1000 US$) and Argentina (26,132.059,1000 US$), followed by Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil and Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile have negative total trade effect. Chile imposes very low tariffs for products originating in Latin America. Any further tariff liberalization in Latin America makes goods cheaper of other Latin American countries. Therefore, in Chile one sees higher trade diversion than trade creation leading to negative total trade effect. The total import change for all countries in the Worlds is 110,484.049,1000 US $. United States, Mexico and Spain, among others are the most affected because of substantial trade diversion effect.

Simulation Two: Table XIII bellow shows the tariff liberalization impact of liberalizing trade of 20 products (at two digit level) with the China, Japan and the US. One would have expected larger gains as compared to a scenario when Ecuador liberalized its trade with MERCOSUR countries (like in the case of CSG goods). Also, the total trade effect is 41,659.447,1000 US $, an amount (increase in imports) lowers than when Ecuador liberalized its trade of 20 products with MERCOSUR, which is 110,484.049,1000 US $. The table also shows that the US gains the most, followed by China and then Japan. The most affected( negative total trade effect) will be Argentina, Chile, Columbia and Peru in the Latin American region while Mexico, Spain and Belgium gets affected the most due to liberalization with the China, Japan and the US.

We repeat the tariff liberalization impact of liberalizing 238 products (6 digit levels) with all regional groups-MERCOSUR, China, Japan and the US considered as one group and EU27 Countries in 2010. We get the same results when we liberalized trade of 20 products. It is beneficial to trade in 238 products (6 digits) with the MERCOSUR trading partners rather than China, Japan and the US or the EU 27. Please see Appendix Tables VII through IX for the results put in the table.

Conclusions from SMART ANALYSIS
In summary It is beneficial to trade in 20 products ( 2 digit) and 238 products( 6 digit) with the MERCOSUR trading partners while for trade in CSG it is better to liberalize trade with the Japan, the US and the China, the main suppliers (exporters)of CSG products.

Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Export Potential and Basis of Trade of Climate ...

III	 Export Potential and Basis of Trade of Climate Smart Goods and Specialized Products of Ecuador Using Gravity Analysis
III.1	 Gravity Analysis
We use the gravity analysis to explain the basis of trade of CSG between Ecuador and countries in MERCOSUR (nine excluding Ecuador), EU27, NAFTA (03 countries), East Asia (11) and India in 2010. We do this regression exercise on cross sectional data for 2010. Gravity Analysis helps us to explain basis of trade of merchandize and services. Gravity model examines the role of tariff barriers, inter country dispersion of income, prices, trade costs, preferential trading arrangements, trade resistance terms, inflations, economic size and endowments, general policy environment and overall infrastructure, distance between trading partner, membership of multilateral agreement, foreign direct investments, common language and borders, common colony, among others on trade of merchandize and services. For Example Gravity Model can explain what is the basis of trade in Climate Smart Goods (64 goods list defined by the UNESCAP). CSG are defined as components, products and technologies which tend to have relatively less adverse impact on the environment. CSGs constitute low carbon technologies such as solar photovoltaic systems, wind power generation, clean coal technologies and energy-efficient lighting. We use variant of the Baier and Bergstrand (2001) Gravity formulation. The theoretical justification of using the present gravity formulation is given in Appendix Table X. This study uses gravity analysis which explains log of imports as a function of log of sum of GDPs of the trading partner, log of distance( capturing trade cost in the form of transportation cost, maybe language barriers ,common border and common preferential trading arrangement), log of inter-country dispersion(log of si*sj), log of tariffs-weighted applied tariffs log (1+tariffs) and log of prices in reporting(importer country) and log of prices in partner(exporter country) We consider 62 trading partners in 2010 . DATA AND DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR GRAVITY ANALYSIS Import data to and from Ecuador of CSG goods-one category made of the list of 64 goods (under 6 Digit HS Combined) is taken from WITS data base for 2010 GDP data of trading partners is expressed in billions of US dollars and the basic source of data is the IMF, World Economic Outlook (April 2011 edition) Distance data is taken from the dist_cepii.xls file of CEPII data base(www.cepii.fr)

Tariff data is applied weighted tariff (%) on CSG goods for each country available from the TRAINS data (within WITS data base) Inter country dispersion is product of two terms si *sj where si=GDPi/(GDPi+GDPj) and sj=GDPj/(GDPi+GDPj). Si and Sjis constructed from GDP data of trading partners. The product has an inverse relationship with variance of country’s share of income in total group income. Variance of country’s share of income in total group income is inversely related to volume of trade between countries. Please see appendix Table X for understanding the relationship between volume of trade and inter country dispersion of income. Prices data of reporter (importer) and partner (exporter) from the GDP deflators available from the World Bank World Development Indicators available at the World Bank website for 2010(Index Numbers)

Hypotheses
•	 Sum of GDPs (sizes) matter for imports of country. Positive sign is hypothesized •	 Distance is negatively related to imports. Greater distance means larger transportation cost, maybe higher language barriers, no common borders and limited access to each other’s goods because of limited open regionalism. •	 Lower is the inter country dispersion of income (si*sj) higher is the trade between countries (Helpman and Krugman, 1985). See Appendix Table X for understanding the relationship between equality of income and volume of trade. •	 Larger are the tariffs, lower will be the imports as tariffs are trade costs

•	 Higher prices in reporter country increases imports while lower prices in partner country lowers imports. Higher the price in the exporter’s country more is the incentive to supply CSG goods abroad. •	 All variables are in logs(natural) so the estimates of parameters will capture elasticity of explanatory variables with respect to imports

All variables explaining imports of Ecuador of CSG to and from its trading partners come with the usual sign except partner countries prices. Maybe CSG goods which have relatively low tariffs are traded at free trade prices and lower prices increases import demand. All are statistically significant (from t values and associated p values) except tariffs. R2 is 0.66 showing a good fit. White consistent standard errors takes care of heteroscedasticity. F test indicates overall importance of all variables taken together. Standardized beta coefficients (not shown) results show that size of trading partner is the most important explanatory variable explaining trade of Ecuador of CSG with its trading partner. Then comes inter country dispersion of income, followed by distance, followed by reporter(importer) country’s prices followed by exporter country’s prices and then at the

last are the tariffs(any way relatively lower for CSG products than what are with respect to total trade of Ecuador or trade of specialized products). Then, why do we need tariff liberalization for CSG goods. Tariff liberalization may lead countries to achieve positive effective protection level if that is in country’s interest. Trade in CSG consists mostly of component trade (inputs) to cleaner technologies and thus is also associated with transfer and investment into new technologies. Also, those Latin American countries who have a sufficiently large domestic market to develop cost effective manufacturing capacities at different stages of the supply chain may be more interested in liberalizing imports of certain intermediate products (such as solar cells, silicon ingots, gear boxes, and electronic control equipment). On the other hand, some of the Latin countries including Ecuador may need a certain level of tariff protection to build up local capacities and probably attract some FDI as well. Also, one cannot undermine the role of tariffs as trade of CSG is component trade (components to clean low carbon technologies) and such products cross custom boundaries many times.. Higher incomes a mean larger demand for climate smart components for cleaner technologies (based on knowledge from research on environmental Kuznetz curve). Higher incomes also lead to generation of resources to adopt cleaner technologies often with higher FDI and better infrastructure. However, in many developing countries a number of non technological and economic factors stand in a way for deployment of cleaner technologies. These include insufficient technical knowledge and absorption capacity to produce these innovative technologies locally, insufficient market size to justify local production units and insufficient purchasing power and financial resources to acquire the innovative products (Jha, 2009). The extended gravity model used in the study (Mathur, 2011) analyzed ESCAP countries trade of CSG with host of countries. The study found a weak positive impact of regional trade agreements, mitigation policy and infrastructure on import of CSGs. Perhaps an inclusion of variables such as carbon taxation and domestic regulations would improve the model’s explanatory power. Other possible variables including environmental subsidies, funding of environmental research projects, degree of industrialization, privatization and deregulation of markets, domestic standards and certification requirements, and domestic policies related to IPR, all of which could potentially improve the model. However data on such possibly useful variables are not available for a sufficient number of countries in the region. In addition, from the analysis done by Mathur (2011) it appears that language, domestic regulations, and the level of certifications and standards could play a particularly important role in stimulating trade in CSGs. The analysis also showed that tariffs do not appear to play a huge role in determining trade in CSGs.

III.2	

Gravity Analysis: Potential of Trade (Export) for Ecuador in CSG Products in2010

We use the estimated equation of the gravity model to predict the values of imports (log). If the actual imported values of CSG exceed the fitted values, we call it import potential for the importing country or export potential for the Exporting Country. We get the following results. The first column depicts the import potential of the reporter or the importing country (second column) or the export potential of the exporting country (third column and is Ecuador). Positive values mean positive export potential (for exporters-Ecuador) or import potential (for importers). Ecuador seems to have positive export potential for CSG products with respect to Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Singapore. The export potential with respect to its four Latin American Partners works out to be 34.84 million US $. There is, however, negative potential for exports of CSG to all its Latin American partners taken together (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela of the tune of negative 4.9 million. This is because of high negative potential with respect to Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. These countries may be are more inclined towards exporting the CSG products to Ecuador rather

than importing it. SMART analysis had shown that it is more beneficial for Ecuador to liberalize its trade with the China, Japan and the US. Both Ecuador and the trading partners China, Japan and the US gain by such a move. The next table (next section) confirms the same. There is lot of potential gains (for both Exporters and for Ecuador importing the CSG product) if Ecuador liberalizes its trade with the China, Japan, the US and the EU.

Gravity Analysis: Export Potential in CSG for Other Countries targeting Ecuador

The export potential for China, Japan and the US works out to be 95 million US $ in CSG. The export potential of the Latin American partners( Columbia, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela) works out to be little more than 13 million US $. This confirms the SMART results earlier that for Ecuador, it is more beneficial for Ecuador to liberalize its CSG trade with the China, Japan, the US and EU27 rather than with MERCOSUR countries. There are more gains for both Ecuador and its trading partners if its liberalizes its trade of CSG with the most efficient suppliers of CSG products, the Japan, the China, EU27 and the US.

Keep focusing on increasing growth rates of GDP of all Lower inter country dispersion of income Lower trade costs between countries by having open regionalism policies, reduce transportation costs within and between countries, lower border disputes to have open trade between neighboring countries. Increase prices for exporters and lower prices of CSG goods in importers country by focusing on having sound competition policies, effective legislations for sound environmental policy( say increasing paper less trade and single window clearance as a starting point, carbon tax and regional emission trading system), appropriate regulatory framework, financial infrastructure and investment climate for production of CSGs, having appropriate standards and labels, mechanism of technology transfer, mechanisms to promote CSG trade among countries by coordination and cooperation and promoting R&D activities for CSG products among countries

Environmental Sustainability in Ecuador

As regards the international scene in the fields of the environment and sustainable development, Ecuador has ratified the main conventions (Biodiversity, Desertification, and Climate Change) and, in particular, the Kyoto Protocol in 1999. Ecuador has a good background in terms of environmental legislation, strategies and plans, dating back to the beginning of the 1980s. Possibly, this can be the reason of having some positive trade balance for Climate Smart Goods with the Latin American trading partners in 2010( see Table I above). The Environmental issues and policies need to be very high on the agendas of governments. The country faces many other serious threats including intensive deforestation (mainly caused by encroaching agriculture, logging, and exploitation of hydrocarbons); a significant loss of biodiversity, soil and water pollution (mainly due to mining and hydrocarbon extraction); erosion caused by poor agricultural practices in vulnerable areas (leading to erosion and desertification); institutional weakness in ensuring compliance with the legal framework; and a lack of local and national capacity to develop and sustain effective environmental management, both generally and in sensitive areas such as the Amazon and the Galápagos Islands. The challenge is to tackle all these problems on the basis of a land-use planning model that promotes environmental awareness and sustainable development, ensures that disaster risk reduction is incorporated within all activities, secures the rational use of natural resources and, where relevant, protects the rights of indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorean peoples living in the affected areas (European Commission, Ecuador Strategy Paper, 2007). Promoting the CSG goods will be the good strategy for sustainable growth, having safe and secure energy source, directing social spending towards low carbon emanating technologies and promotion of small and medium enterprises for production of CSG goods. Various national and international policies can be followed by Ecuador and its trading partners to promote trade of CSG goods. Gravity analysis (third objective) reinforces the below points •	 Keep focusing on increasing growth rates of GDP of all. Larger sizes promote trade of Climate Smart Goods. •	 Lower inter country dispersion of income for promoting trade of CSG among countries •	 Lower trade costs between countries by having open regionalism policies, reduce transportation costs within and between countries, lower border disputes to have open trade between neighboring countries. •	 Increase prices for exporters and lower prices of CSG goods in importers country by focusing on having sound competition policies, effective legislations for sound environmental policy( say increasing paper less trade and single window clearance as a starting point, carbon tax and regional emission trading system),

appropriate regulatory framework, financial infrastructure and investment climate for production of CSGs, having appropriate standards and labels, mechanism of technology transfer, mechanisms to promote CSG trade among countries by coordination and cooperation and promoting R&D activities for CSG products among countries •	 Lower tariffs by small countries in the American Peninsula for imports of CSG from Ecuador. In particular there is potential to reduce tariffs(Applied duties) by Dijbouti(26%), Belize(15%), Costa Rica(10%), Guaetmala(11.97%), Honduras(9.87%), Nicaragua(12.49%), Cuba(8.99%) and El Salvador(12%). Following are the potential barriers to production, trade and investment of CSG. Ecuadorian governments need to attend to the following points •	 Low level of competition •	 Limited foreign ownership •	 Inefficient transmission and grid interconnection •	 Limited access to local financing •	 Inadequate training and skills to produce CSGs •	 Weak Intellectual property rights enforcement Climate change specific policies may include the following for Ecuador. This is adapted from the studies undertaken by UNESCAP (2011, a, b). It will help Ecuador to adapt and acclimatize itself to the CSG environment

Trade in Climate Smart Goods 1)	 Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA)

Export Potential and Basis of Trade of Climate ...

Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) are voluntary emission reduction measures undertaken by countries that are reported by national governments to UNFCCC, and can cover any policy that works towards reducing Green House Gas(GHG) emissions. In principle, this means that NAMAs also cover carbon-friendly trade and investment policies. Apart from the policies discussed in this study, NAMAs cover a wide range of policy areas, including sectoral policies. NAMAs involve improvements of land, soil and water management The idea is that some policies that are effective in some countries may not be effective in others, so the countries themselves should be able to design their own mitigation strategies. Whatever strategy a country chooses, it must conform to international trade rules if they affect trade. NAMAs ensure that mitigation actions undertaken at the national level are recognized internationally and that they will bolster the demand for CSGTs, particularly in renewables. However, it is important to have a proper monitoring, evaluation and verification process in place with clear objective indicators and measurements to ensure that NAMAs are actually implemented 2)	 National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) NAPAs can take many forms, including awareness creating campaigns, the construction of flood shelters and flood protection systems (dams, dykes etc.), research and development of drought and saline tolerant crops, evacuation of coastal areas and retraining facilities. Many such actions require substantive amounts of investment and thus offer investment opportunities. 3)	 Environmental policy (environmental standards, carbon taxes should be designed carefully so that national and international companies get affected in the same manner, cap-and-trade schemes for greenhouse gas reductions, also know as Emission Trading Schemes) Emission Trading Schemes or Systems (ETS) at the national, regional or multilateral level, i.e. CDM under the Kyoto Protocol, set an aggregate limit on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted annually by certain capped sources. Subject to the overall limit, capped sources may buy and sell permits for the right to emit GHGs. 4)	 Industrial policy (including energy efficiency standards) Energy efficiency labels are informative labels attached to manufactured products to describe the product’s energy performance (usually in the form of energy use, efficiency or energy cost). These labels give consumers the data necessary to make informed purchases, and to promote the trade and purchase of CSGs and other green products. Carbon standards are an important tool for informing consumers of the carbon footprint of a particular product as well as for indirectly encouraging domestic demand for, and production of products on the basis of RE 5)	 Public procurement of energy efficient products Sustainable public procurement is a tool that allows governments to leverage public spending in order to promote the country’s social, environmental and economic policies. It provides governments with a powerful tool to influence the way in which businesses operate through purchasing decisions. Government procurement often involves large sums, with regard to investment projects and in the procurement of goods and services for consumption. More importantly, it includes the procurement of key infrastructure, such as power- and

transport-related infrastructure as well as public buildings, i.e. the type of investments that will have an impact on GHG emission levels for many years to come. By applying clear sustainability criteria in purchasing and investment decisions, governments can provide a major driving force for lowering emissions. First, this will help to ensure that public investments are low-emitting and use low GHG-emitting input materials. Second, in so doing, this will stimulate the market for environmental goods and services, thus stimulating innovation and increasing the competitiveness of such goods and services, both locally and globally. By actually encouraging green procurement practices in government activities, new markets for indigenous green products and services can be developed 6)	 Energy policy (e.g. requirements of renewable/low-carbon energy shares in energy mix of utilities, feed-in tariffs, subsidies and incentives for low-carbon investments). Policies to be in consonance with the WTO provisions 7)	 Technology policy (related to generation, dissemination and diffusion of chronology policy (related generation, low-carbon know-how) 8)	 Trade policy adjustments for low-carbon activities (e.g. tariff reductions for capital goods/inputs for lowcarbon activities, tariff policy of the home country with respect to potential host countries – for export activities of Multinational Companies) 9)	 Incentives for manufacturers of low carbon goods and/or providers of energy efficiency or process improvement services (e.g. tax benefits, subsidies concessionary loans, export guarantee insurance). Policies to be in consonance with the 	 WTO provisions

10)	Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Closely related to cap-and-trade systems is the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) mechanism, which uses market/financial incentives to reduce GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Such actions offset carbon emissions and contribute to carbon credits. Actions involve reforestation and afforestation. REDD”+” adds to these actions in order to include the possibility of offsetting emissions through sustainable forest management, conservation and increasing forest carbon stocks. REDD and REDD+ are important for business as such actions contribute to sustainable business practices, ensuring sustained long-term supplies of forest-based raw materials for a variety of industries (e.g. furniture, and pulp and paper), and the preservation of forests with added benefits such as conservation of bio-diversity. Actions involving REDD are important NAMAs and are potentially an important carbon offset credit under cap-andtrading schemes. Forest-rich countries stand to potentially benefit from REDD projects. Apart from REDD, specific sectoral policies can be designed to mitigate GHG emissions. In various energy-intensive sectors, binding emission reduction targets need to be imposed in combination with emission crediting schemes. In the agricultural sector, land, livestock and waste management needs to be improved while increased attention should be paid to the development of drought or flood-resistant crops. In summary, this policy will include

•	 Creating a financial value for the carbon stored in standing forests; •	 Industrialized countries to make financial transfers to developing countries like Ecuador to compensate them for avoiding deforestation. 11)	Legal framework and compliance mechanisms for climate change mitigation and adaptation This is required for the effective implementation of all NAMAs and NAPAs and any other policy outlined above. A comprehensive “green growth” legislative framework would also ensure the coordination, consistency and coherence among all policies and ensure environmentally sustainable and climate-smart economic growth. 12)	Strengthening supply-side capacities of small and medium-sized enterprises to produce and use CSGs. 13)	Strengthen public-private partnerships and promote adoption and implementation of the principles of corporate social responsibility 14)	 When negotiating trade agreements, ensure broad coverage of CSGs and climate-smart services as well as deep commitments (ideally zero tariffs with generous rules of origin and verifiable NTBs such as standards) 15)	Avoid Non tariff Barriers (NTBs) such as local content requirements, which also discourage investment and may violate the WTO Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) Agreement, and ensure that others (such as standards, taxes and subsidies) are applied in a non-discriminatory manner (national treatment).

16)	Keep Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) open to new members in order to avoid trade diversion. Liberalization of CSGs has more impact with wider membership. Regional cooperation can be in the form of establishment of regional emission trading schemes, regional investment collaboration, regional harmonization of climate smart standards and labels, regional financing schemes, regional cooperation in development of climate smart technologies and technical assistance. 17)	Promote exports of CSGs through environmental regulations and incentives while avoiding restrictive trade practices, including Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs), which may violate WTO rules or otherwise constitute distortions of international trade 18)	Apart from subsidies there are other financial instruments for supporting the production and development of CSGs. Many of those instruments have close links to subsidies or are themselves subsidies in disguise. In particular, development banks can provide soft loans for such purposes, refinanced by governments. Such loans offer flexible or lenient terms for repayment, usually at lower than market interest rates. In particular, such loans could be channelled to SMEs to raise their capacity to adopt green practices (e.g. acquire or develop CSTs). For example, the India Renewable Energy Development Agency provides loans for clean energy projects while government low interest loans have assisted in the development of the PV industry in the Republic of Korea. Green bonds are tax-exempt bonds that are issued by qualified central or local government agencies for the development of environmentally-friendly projects. A related concept is climate bonds, which are bonds issued by a government or corporate entity in order to raise finance for climate change mitigation or adaptation-related programmes or projects. All funds raised from such bonds will only go to climate-related programmes or assets, such as Renewable Energy plants or climate mitigation focused funding programmes. Various provisions in the tax code could be made to allow suitable tax breaks for enterprises or adopt relaxed tax calculation methods based on the equipment and technologies (and their depreciation) used by enterprises. Tax breaks could be given to enterprises that undertake R&D in CSGs or development of CSGs, and/or enterprises that are actually already producing such goods and climate-smart services. Such measures are normally associated with the promotion of investment .In the absence of an internationally agreed-defined list of CSGs and climate-smart services, countries could adopt their own lists for tax purposes. Another enduser type of innovative financing mechanism is dealer-credit financing where the Renewable Energy provider obtains a loan from a financial institution, either national or international, which is then converted into a loan to consumers so that they can purchase the appropriate Renewable Energy Technology. Additional financial instruments include risk-sharing instruments such as catastrophe bonds, weather derivatives, mutual funds and micro-insurance index-based schemes through partnerships involving the private sector. 19)	SThe Government can help improve the CSG production, trade and investment by adopting the following policies a)	 Start Incubation programmes for small and medium enterprises interested in developing CSGs. b)	 Link Multinationals with domestic enterprises to transfer technology for producing CSGs c)	 Apprise and inform all on standards for motor vehicles;buildings,etc, labels and rules and regulations for producing and importing CSGs d)	 Improve access to finance, strengthen IPR climate, strengthen domestic R&D and national innovation system, hone human resource and skills and promote public and private partnerships for the production of CSGs

Gravity Analysis For Trade Of 20 Specialized Products Of Ecuador

We use the gravity analysis to explain the basis of trade of 20 specialized products between Ecuador and countries in MERCOSUR (nine excluding Ecuador), EU27, NAFTA (03 countries), East Asia (11) and India. We do this regression exercise on cross sectional data for 2010. Gravity Analysis helps us to explain basis of trade of merchandize and services. Gravity model examines the role of tariff barriers, inter country dispersion of income, prices, trade costs, preferential trading arrangements, trade resistance terms, inflations, economic size and endowments, general policy environment and overall infrastructure, distance between trading partner, membership of multilateral agreement, foreign direct investments, common language and borders, common colony, among others on trade of merchandize and services. As before we use variant of the Baier and Bergstrand (2001) Gravity formulation. This study uses gravity analysis which explains log of imports as a function of log of sum of GDPs of the trading partner, log of distance( capturing trade cost in the form of transportation cost, maybe language barriers ,common border and common preferential trading arrangement), log of inter-country dispersion(log of si*sj), log of tariffs-weighted applied tariffslog (1+tariffs) and log of prices in reporting(importer country) and log of prices in partner(exporter country) We consider 65 trading partners in 2010. Import data to and from Ecuador of 20 specialized goods-one category is taken from WITS data base for 2010

Data And Data Requirements For Gravity Analysis
GDP data of trading partners is expressed in billions of US dollars and the basic source of data is the IMF, World Economic Outlook (April 2011 edition) Distance data is taken from the dist_cepii.xls file of CEPII data base (www.cepii.fr) Tariff data is applied weighted tariff (%) for each country is available from the TRAINS data (within WITS data base) Intercountry dispersion is product of two terms si *sj where si=GDPi/(GDPi+GDPj) and sj=GDPj/(GDPi+GDPj). Si and Sjis constructed from GDP data of trading partners. The product has an inverse relationship with variance of country’s share of income in total group income. Variance of country’s share of income in total group income is inversely related to volume of trade between countries. Please see appendix Table VII for understanding the relationship between volume of trade and inter country dispersion of income. Prices data of reporter (importer) and partner (exporter) from the GDP deflators available from the World Bank World Development Indicators available at the World Bank website for 2010(Index Numbers)

•	 HypothesesSum of GDPs (sizes) matter for imports of country. Positive sign is hypothesized •	 Distance is negatively related to imports. Greater distance means larger transportation cost, maybe higher language barriers, no common borders and limited access to each other’s goods because of limited open regionalism. •	 Lower is the inter country dispersion of income(si*sj) higher is the trade between countries (Helpman and Krugman,1985) •	 Larger are the tariffs, lower will be the imports as tariffs are trade costs •	 Higher prices in reporter country increases imports while lower prices in partner country lowers imports. Higher the price in the exporter’s country more is the incentive to supply CSG goods abroad. •	 All variables are in logs(natural) so the estimates of parameters will capture elasticity of explanatory variables with respect to imports

White consistent standard errors take care of Heteroscedasticity. Size of trading partners, distance and tariffs (both have negative impact) matter (statistically) for imports of specialized products to and from Ecuador from MERCOSUR, EU27, EAST ASIA, NAFTA countries and India in 2010. Inter country dispersion of income and prices are not important for trade of 20 specialized products. Unlike trade in CSG, reduction in tariffs are important for movement of Ecuadorian goods across countries

Export Potential of Ecuador to Some Selected Countries: Gravity Analysis

We use the estimated equation of the gravity model to predict the values of imports (log). If the actual imported values of specialized products exceed the fitted values, we call it import potential for the importing country or export potential for the Exporting Country. We get the following results. The first column depicts the import potential of the reporter or the importing country (second column) or the export potential of the exporting country (third column and is Ecuador). Positive values mean positive export potential (for exporters-Ecuador) or import potential (for importers).

Export Potential and Basis of Trade of Climate ...

Limitations of the Study
There are several challenges related to the Harmonized Commodity Coding and Description (HS) system makes it tricky to: •	 Isolate ‘climate-friendly’ products from others for easier trade liberalization. ‘Dual-use’ categories include environmental and non-environmental products. E.g. Efficient supercritical and ultra-supercritical boilers (and turbines) cannot be easily tracked because there is no suitable HS code differentiation for boilers (and turbines) by temperature and pressure. •	 Deal with intrinsically ‘dual-use’ products such as pipes and valves. •	 it is difficult to distinguish between traditional coal and “clean” coal technologies at the HS 6-digit level, a fair amount of the trade analyzed here may in fact still be traditional “dirty” coal technologies. Further examination at a more disaggregated HS level and of regional industry trade trends is needed for a more accurate evaluation. Future Research It will be interesting to find the intensity of carbon emissions of the specialized products of Ecuador at both 2 digits and at 6 digit level of disaggregation. They are probably lower than the EU27, US, China, India and Brazil. Also, emission intensity indices of exports and imports can also be worked out. The values of these indices range from 0 to infinite but the important benchmark is a value equal to 1. For example, if the emission intensity index of imports is larger than 1, emissions embodied in goods produced overseas and transported to a destination are larger than the emissions that would have been caused by local production in that destination of the same amount of goods. In other words, from a climate change perspective, it would have been less damaging to produce these goods locally than to import them. In the opposite case, when the index is less than 1, the environment is less damaged by trade than when no trade takes place. The index value of 1 indicates that emissions associated with imports of goods are the same as those associated with local production replacing trade.

Summary and Policy Conclusions
According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) there is compelling evidence that GHG emissions cause climate change and that most GHG emissions are due to anthropogenic factors. The changes in climate foreseen towards the end of this century involve a gradual warming of the planet, with a temperature increase ranging from 1.1°C to 6.4°C above pre-industrial levels during the twenty-first century. Therefore, there appears to be a certain urgency to initiate actions to curb global GHG emissions and drastically reduce the unsustainable use of so-called carbon sinks, such as the world’s forests and oceans, in order to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 2°C, which is the rate at which climate change can still be managed. This study details various policies including trade and investment policies in Climate Smart Goods(CSGs) to limit climate change. Climate Smart Goods are defined as broadly as products, components and technologies that tend to have less adverse impact on climate change (greenhouse gas emissions10) and environment in general. The study considers a 64 goods list of CSG floated by the UNESCAP- APTIR (2011), basically constituting low carbon emanating industries. Access to CSG is very

important for implementation of various strategies of technological transformation deemed necessary to mitigate climate change. For example, CSGs consists of articles of iron and steel and aluminum, machinery and mechanical appliances, electrical machinery equipment, ships, boats and floating structures, glass and glass ware articles, among others. One of the subcategories of CSG clean coal technology aims to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, including technologies of coal extraction, coal preparation and coal utilization. Wind technology another sub category of CGS focuses on wind energy generation and is composed of three integral components: the gear box, coupling and wind turbine. Wind power and turbine production has experienced stupendous growth over recent years and is now one of the most widespread forms of climate smart technologies. As the region will have to come to terms with the expected effects of climate change, there is a collective need to increase trade and investment in these goods, which would benefit companies in different parts of the supply chain, and, hence all countries, no matter what their stage of development. The interest in the subject of Trade in Climate Smart Goods was fuelled by Ecuador’s positive trade balance with the rest of the Andean Community and MERCOSUR region in 2010. This may be a reflection of Ecuador’s maturity in dealing with environmental issues since the early 1980s. It may be also due to preferential trade policies followed upon by member nations of the ANDEAN region. Or, the above trend can be just a consequence of their fast export growth. One, however, would like to establish with more certainty the association of various policies that have been put in place to help mitigate climate change and trade pattern changes. The study looks closely at the trade indices, worked out for Ecuador’s total trade, CSG trade and specialized products and uses gravity analysis which helps in finding the export potential for trade in CSG and other products. As Ecuador in the Latin American region probably continues to design policies more conducive to fostering climate smart development, their domestic capacity to meet the increased domestic demand for climate smart goods and services, and then foreign demand through exports, is likely to increase. Depending on the relative strengths of the incentives between those in the region and outside, trade flows and patterns of the region is being affected possibly by reorienting the Ecuadorian trade more towards the intra-regional focus and hence the positive trade balance with the ANDEAN and MERCOSUR region. Whatever may be the exact reason, one thing which surely comes out of the study (SMART analysis) is that for Ecuador it will be better to liberalize CSG trade with the leading suppliers of the CSG goods, the China, Japan and the US. In particular, Ecuador had a comparative advantage in the production of two Industry codes out of 64 goods list (based on RCA analysis). These industries are 732111 Solar driven stoves, ranges, grates, cookers (including those with subsidiary boilers for central heating), barbecues, braziers, gas-rings, plate warmers and similar non-electric domestic appliances, and parts thereof, of iron or steel. 732190 Stoves, ranges, grates, cookers (including those with subsidiary boilers for central heating), barbecues, braziers, gas-rings, plate warmers and similar non-electric domestic appliances, and parts thereof, of iron or steel. These industries have potential for greater trade and inward foreign direct investment. The study identifies the markets for the same using the Export Specialization Index. These are Chile, Columbia and Peru. Gravity analysis helps us to work out

the export potential of Ecuador for 64 goods list of CSG. The export potential of Ecuador to four Latin American –Bolivia, Chile, Columbia and Peru is 34.79 million US$. However, the greater potential lies with the other countries marketing the CSG goods in Ecuador. These countries include the most efficient suppliers of CSG goods, the China, Japan and the US.SMART results confirm that Ecuador will gain more( in terms of total trade effect, welfare and consumer surplus effects) by liberalizing its imports of Climate Smart Goods with the China, Japan and the US instead of MERCOSUR or EU27 countries. Trade in CSG will help Ecuador to promote alternative industries in the face of Global Economic Downturn. Also, it will help country to look for safe, alternative and reliable energy source rather than believing in trade of crude and Petroleum Oil only or investing a great deal in nuclear energy. Nuclear energy was in the brink of being affected in Japan due to recent Earthquake in Japan. Ecuador can direct its social spending in promoting small industries which can provide CSG goods at low cost. Countries can gain in terms of their comparative advantage and establish new industries. Positions keep changing in terms of the advantage of producing goods and services. Based on our analysis and review of studies done on CSG (APTIR, 2011, ICSTD, WTO and World Bank) one may conclude that various national and international policies can be followed by Ecuador and its trading partners to promote trade of CSG goods. Gravity analysis (third objective) reinforces the below points •	 Keep focusing on increasing growth rates of GDP of all. Larger size promotes trade of Climate Smart Goods. •	 Lower inter country dispersion of income for promoting trade of CSG among countries •	 Lower trade costs between countries by having open regionalism policies, reduce transportation costs within and between countries, lower border disputes to have open trade between neighboring countries.

•	 Increase prices for exporters and lower prices of CSG goods in importers country by focusing on having sound competition policies, effective legislations for sound environmental policy( say increasing paper less trade and single window clearance as a starting point, carbon tax and regional emission trading system), appropriate regulatory framework, financial infrastructure and investment climate for production of CSGs, employ feed in tariffs for promoting CSGs, have appropriate standards and labels, mechanism of technology transfer, mechanisms to promote CSG trade among countries by coordination and cooperation and promoting R&D activities for CSG products among countries •	 Lower tariffs by small countries in the American Peninsula for imports of CSG from Ecuador. In particular there is potential to reduce tariifs(Applied duties) by Dijbouti(26%), Belize(15%), Costa Rica(10%), Guaetmala(11.97%), Honduras(9.87%), Nicaragua(12.49%), Cuba(8.99%) and El Salvador(12%) Countries including Ecuador need to design sustainable and climate smart growth that entails sharply reduced GHG emissions to a level of 450 ppm( or may be lower) and that limits the global temperature rise to not more than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The stud lists such policies and is not confined to trade policies alone. Trade policies related to CSG though are the main focus of this study. The entire set of policies which can reduce GHG emissions and limit climate change can be structured into regulatory measures( including regulations, standards and labeling), economic incentives( including taxes, tradable permits and subsidies conforming to WTO laws and provisions), trade and investment policies and financial, energy and enterprise development policies, among others. Regional climate-smart value chains could provide new opportunities for many less developed economies in the region to become parts and components suppliers to the leading CSG exporters in Latin American Region and other regions. At the same time, the capacity of domestic SMEs in the area of CSGs should be enhanced so that they can evolve into suppliers of low-carbon products and become effectively integrated with low-carbon value chains. The study is also able to identify some specialized industries and identify markets for the two digit and 6 digit industries for Ecuador using RCA and Export Specialization index. There are 20 such products at the two digit level and 238 products/ industrial codes at 6 digit level disaggregation in 2010 were in Ecuador has a comparative advantage in production. These industrial sectors are potential for inviting FDI into Ecuador. Export specialization and HH indices indicate the more concentrated nature of Ecuadorian production and trade structure. Ecuador needs to rethink its trade policy by diversifying its trade into manufactured products and more diversified production structure. Information Technology services, Tourism, Manufacturing of Automobiles, Education and Training Services, Bio combustibles, Housing materials, Pharmaceutical industries, Health Products and Hospital services, Hardware production, Industrial and Textile Goods and Chemicals are some areas where Ecuador can think of developing niche and cater to European markets. Production and Trade in Climate Smart Goods is another area of focus. In particular, study identifies the following industries for further diversifying industrial structure of Ecuador for its gain in future. These are Industrial Codes- 61(Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted), 62(Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, not knitted or crocheted),42( Articles of leather; saddlery and harness; travel goods, handbags and similar containers; articles of animal), 90(Optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments and apparatus; parts and accessories thereof), 84(Electronic appliances), 85(Electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof; sound recorders and reproducers, television image and sound recorders and reproducers, and parts and accessories of such articles),87 (Vehicles other than railway or tramway rolling-

In services sector, Tourism, IT and ITES, Hospital services, Education and Training Services( training of English), Cultural Services, Knowledge Processing Outsourcing and Financial Analytics, Infrastructure services have lot of potential of bring the necessary foreign exchange and stability into the system .Ecuador need to diversify into the following industries and services for higher and more stable export earnings, job creation and learning effects, and the development of new skills and infrastructure that would facilitate the development of even newer export products. Gravity Analysis has been used in this study the basis of trade of CSG goods of Ecuador and Trade of 20 specialized products in 2010. Further, the variant of the Baier and Bergstrand (2001) gravity model has been used to work out the export potential of CSG and specialized products to and from Ecuador. The theoretical justification of extending the most simple Gravity model, as used in this study, is done using extensions of work done by Helpman and Krugman (1985). Appendix Table X gives the note linking less dispersion of income with volume of trade. SMART analysis on trade liberalization shows that it is beneficial to trade in 20(2digit level) and 238 products (at 6 digit level) with the MERCOSUR trading partners while for trade in CSG it is better to liberalize trade with the Japan, the US and the China, the main suppliers (exporters) of CSG products rather than EU 27 and MERCOSUR Countries in 2010.

Table VI	 Equations for Trade Creation and Trade Diversion

where t MFN is the Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff imposed on good g, and θ g ,c is the g tariff preference ratio on good g when imported from country c.1

MFN By (4), θ g ,c = 1 − t g ,c t g .

Trade creation Trade creation is defined as the direct increase in imports following a reduction on the tariff imposed on good g from country c. To obtain this, SMART uses the definition of price elasticity of import demand: dm g ,c m g ,c <0 d dp gd ,c p g ,c

Brain power

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative knowhow is crucial to running a large proportion of the world’s wind turbines. Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to maintenance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic lubrication. We help make it more economical to create cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, industries can boost performance beyond expectations. Therefore we need the best employees who can meet this challenge!

Appendix

If the tariff reduction on good g from country c is a preferential tariff reduction (i.e., it does not apply to other countries, c , then imports from country), then imports of good g from country c are further going to increase due to the substitution away from imports of good g from other countries that becomes relatively more expensive. This is the definition of trade diversion in the SMART model. In order to measure trade diversion, let us use the definition of the elasticity of substitution, σ g ,c ,≠c across imports of good g from country c and all other countries ( c ):

σ g ,c,≠c

Trade in Climate Smart Goods

Appendix

Table X: 	 Theoretical Justification of Using the Gravity Model (in this Study) and Volume of Trade and Trade Equality
To understand the relationship between dispersions of incomes across countries and volume of trade we refer to the most simple version of the Gravity Model. The most simple version relates volume of trade between two countries is directly proportional to GDP of the exporting country( higher the GDP, higher is the number of varieties produced, more are the varieties traded), the relative size of the importing country approximated by the importing country’s share in World GDP and inversely related to the distance between countries. Therefore, Trade=( GDP1*share)/Distn= (1/GDPw). (GDP1* GDP2)/ Distn Start with the GDP of Country 1, GDP1.Each of the goods produced in Country 1 is a differentiated product, so they are different from the varieties produced in other countries. Every other country will demand the goods of Country 1(because they are different from their home produced goods), and the amount of their demand will depend on two factors (1) the relative size of the importing country because larger countries demand more and (2) the distance between two countries because being farther away will lead to higher transportation costs and less trade. We use the most simple Gravity Model (without distance) to show the relationship between inequality of income and volume of trade. Consider a model of all differentiated goods with same and homothetic tastes. The utility function is Dixit Stiglitz Utility Function with all varieties entering the utility function. Consider three countries (1, 2 and 3) in the entire world. The volume of trade is worked out using the simple matrix below To Imports from Country Exports from Country!
Country1 Country 1 Country2 Country3 Volume of Trade GDP2*s1 GDP3*s1 GDP2*s1 +GDP3*s1 GDP3*s2 GDP1*s2 +GDP3*s2 GDP1*s3 +GDP2*s3 Country2 GDP1*s2 Country3 GDP1*s3 GDP2*s3 Volume of Trade GDP1*s2+ GDP1*s3 GDP2*s1+ GDP2*s3 GDP3*s1+ GDP3*s2 Total Volume Of Trade= GDP1*s2+ GDP1*s3 +GDP2*s1+ GDP2*s3 +GDP3*s1+ GDP3*s2= GDP2*s1 +GDP3*s1 +GDP1*s2 +GDP3*s2 +GDP1*s3 +GDP2*s3

Here sj=GDPj/GDPw j=1,2,3 GDP1+GDP2+GDP3=GDPw Total Volume of Trade= GDP2*s1 +GDP3*s1 +GDP1*s2 +GDP3*s2 +GDP1*s3 +GDP2*s3

s1(GDPw-GDP1)

+s2(GDPw-GDP2)+s3(GDPw-GDP3)=GDPw(s1+s2+s3)-∑sjGDPj=GDPw-∑sj

∑sj )=GDPw(1-H), where H is the Herfindahl Index of Trade Concentration. Consider now the World with n countries. Also, now countries 1, 2 and 3 form a preferential trading arrangement (say A). See how reducing dispersion of income across countries will increase volume of trade between countries. Sj=GDPj/GDPw=(GDPj/GDPA)*(GDPA/GDPw)=sjA*sA,  GDP1+GDP2+GDP3=GDPA,sA= GDPA/GDPw Now Total Volume of Trade (VT) between countries 1, 2 and 3 in a World of n countries= GDPAsA-∑sjGDPj= GDPAsA-∑ sjA*sA* sjA*GDPA= GDPAsA(1-∑sjA2)= GDPAsA(1-HA)=VTA. The volume of trade between any other three countries who have formed an economic union(B), will be VTB= GDPBsB (1-HB). If sA=sB, then regional group whose HA<HB, then VTA>VTB. In another words regional groups whose trade is less concentrated than another region whose trade is more concentrated, the volume of trade in the first group( among itself) will be larger. Also, volume of trade and term(1-∑sjA2) is directly and positively related. One can prove that Variance of sjA and term (1-∑sjA2) is inversely related. Therefore, lower dispersion of income across countries in terms of their GDP share in regional GDP will increase volume of trade in the region. Further, in regional group if there are only two countries, then term (1-∑sjA2) is equal to 2si*sj. Baier and Bergstrand (2001) in his gravity formulation include among traditional variables (size of trading partners and distance and other trade cost), include term si*sj as indicator of dispersion of income between two countries and prices of traded goods in exporting and importing countries. The study also uses Baier and Bergstrand gravity formulation. where

Appendix Table XII: 	 Various Important Meetings Held by International Community to Tackle Climate Change
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit), held in Rio de Janeiro on 14 June 1992 was a summit held under the aegis of the United Nations. The issue was sustainable development of countries. It was the planet’s first summit to discuss global warming related issues. The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The major feature of the Kyoto Protocol is that it sets binding targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions .These amount to an average of five per cent against 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008-2012. The major distinction between the Protocol and the Convention is that while the Convention encouraged industrialised countries to stabilize GHG emissions, the Protocol commits them to do so. Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity, the Protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities.” The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. The detailed rules for the implementation of the Protocol were adopted at COP 7 in Marrakesh in 2001, and are called the “Marrakesh Accords.” The Kyoto mechanisms under the Treaty, countries must meet their targets primarily through national measures. However, the Kyoto Protocol offers them an additional means of meeting their targets by way of three market-based mechanisms. The Kyoto mechanisms are: •	 Emissions trading – known as “the carbon market” •	 Clean development mechanism (CDM) •	 Joint implementation (JI). The mechanisms help stimulate green investment and help Parties meet their emission targets in a cost-effective way. The Bali Action Plan is part of the Bali Road Map agreed to at the Thirteenth Session of the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC in Bali in December 2007. The Action Plan encompasses a comprehensive process to enable the implementation of the UNFCCC through long-term cooperative action up to and beyond 2012, by addressing the following pillars: (a) a shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions; (b) enhanced national/international action on mitigation of climate change; (c) enhanced action on adaptation; (d) enhanced action on technology development and transfer to support action on mitigation and adaptation; (e) enhanced action on the provision of financial resources and investment to support action on mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation. Copenhagen Accord, 2009, reaffirms the importance of restricting global temperature rise to 2°C. It is not considered to be a legally binding agreement like the Kyoto Protocol. The Accord requires Annex I signatories to submit individual mitigation targets and non Annex I countries to submit NAMAs. Annex I countries are those member countries of UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol that are classified as industrialized countries and as countries with economies in

transition. Annex II countries, a subgroup of Annex I countries, comprise the developed countries that pay for the costs of developing countries. In addition, there is the group of developing countries (non-Annex I countries). Of particular concern, however, is the fact that the estimated sum of submitted targets by Annex I countries falls markedly short of limiting CO2e concentrations to 450 ppm and the associated rise in global average temperatures of 2°C. The urgency to tackle climate change was again underscored at COP16 in Cancún, Mexico, held from 29 November to 10 December 2010 and COP17 in Durban, South Africa, held from 28 November to 9 December 2011. The agreement adopted by COP16 called again for a paradigm shift towards building a low-carbon society and establishing a “Green Climate Fund” worth $100 billion annually by 2020, to assist poorer countries in financing emission reductions and adaptation. It also established a Technology Mechanism, which will consist of a Technology Executive Committee, and a Climate Technology Centre and Network. COP17 agrees to an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, by five years and to advance the implemention of the Bali Action Plan, agreed at COP 13 in 2007, and the Cancún Agreements. The “Durban Platform for Enhanced Action” commits all countries to cut carbon emissions for the first time. A road map guides countries towards the conclusion of a legal agreement which includes mandatory cuts in carbon emissions for all countries by 2015, but the agreement will only come into affect from 2020 onwards.
