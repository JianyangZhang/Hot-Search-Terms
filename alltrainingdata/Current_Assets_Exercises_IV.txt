Problem 1

Problem 1
Jill Hansen owns Interior Designs, a furniture store. One of her most popular items is a leather recliner. Following is the recliner inventory activity for August. The recliners on hand at August 1 had a unit cost of $280.
Date 01-Aug 04-Aug 20-Aug 25-Aug 29-Aug 180 units @ $340 each 110 units @ $590 each 120 units @ $300 each 140 units @ $510 each Purchases Sales Units on Hand 80 200 60 240 130

a)	 If Interior Designs uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory method (periodic approach), what values would be assigned to ending inventory and cost of goods sold? How much is gross profit? b)	 If Interior Designs uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method (periodic approach), what values would be assigned to ending inventory and cost of goods sold? How much is gross profit? c)	 If Interior Designs uses the weighted-average inventory method (periodic approach), what values would be assigned to ending inventory and cost of goods sold? How much is gross profit?

Problem 2
James Jenkins is conducting an audit of the computerized inventory system used by Clear Windows Corporation. James has inserted hypothetical data into the computer program that tracks inventory on a perpetual basis. Below are the hypotheical data inserted by James:
Transaction Beginning inventory Purchase, day 1 Sale, day 2 Purchase, day 3 Sale, day 4 Units 30 15 18 24 27 $36 Cost per unit $30 $33

The computer program returned the following ending inventory values: FIFO Perpetual, $864 LIFO Perpetual, $720 Moving average, $792 Which of the three values appears to be incorrect, and what “error” might be causing this condition?

Moving Average:
Date Day 0 Day 1 15 X $33 = $495 Note: Average cost = $1,395/45 units = $31 Day 2 Day 3 24 X $36 = $864 Note: Average cost = $1,701/51 units = $33.3529 Day 4 Ending 27 X $33.3529 = $900.53 18 X $31 = $558 Purchases Cost of Goods Sold Balance 30 X $30 = $900 30 X $30 = $900 15 X $33 = $495 $1,395 27 X $31 = $837 27 X $31 = $837 24 X $36 = $864 $1,701 24 X $33.3529 = $800.47 24 X $33.3529 = $800.47

The computer program returned the wrong value for the Moving Average method ($792 instead of the correct $800.47). Perhaps the program simply averaged the unit cost (($30 + $33 + $36)/3) at $33. $33 × 24 units = the wrong amount ($792). It is important to weight the average cost on a moving basis, as shown.

Team Tennis Store has a number of tennis rackets in stock. All units are priced to provide a normal profit margin of $75. Some of these units are quite old. Carson’s has concluded that some “lower-of-cost-ormarket” adjustments may be needed, and has gathered the following unit pricing data: Wood Racket, $450 cost, $475 replacement cost, $150 selling price Aluminum Racket, $400 cost, $125 replacement cost, $250 selling price Graphite, $200 cost, $160 replacement cost, $200 selling price Composit Racket, $300 cost, $375 replacement cost, $400 selling price a)	 What unit value should be attached to each type of racket, assuming item-by-item application of the lower-of-cost-or-market rule? b)	 Assuming an item-by-item application of the lower-of-cost-or-market rule, what journal entry is needed to reduce the Wood Tennis Racket? 7 such units remain in stock.

Problem 6
Maverick Equipment Rental was burglarized in February of 20X7. It is unclear how many items were stolen. Maverick and its insurance company are currently working to estimate the dollar value of the stolen goods in order to reach a financial settlement under the existing property insurance policy. Maverick’s tax return prepared at the end of 20X6 revealed that the company ended 20X6 with a total inventory of $567,000. Maverick uses the same inventory accounting methods for tax and accounting purposes. The insurance company has contacted Maverick’s suppliers and confirmed Maverick’s claim that purchases for 20X7, prior to the date of the burglary, were $1,128,000. All inventory was purchased, FOB destination. 20X7 Sales taxes collected by Maverick and remitted to the state, prior to the date of the theft, were $132,000. The sales tax rate is 7% of sales. An inventory was taken immediately after the burglary and the cost of Equipment in stock was $369,000. Maverick consistently sells equipment at a gross profit margin of 30%. Use the gross profit method to estimate the dollar value of stolen equipment.

Based on the gross profit technique, it appears that equipment on hand before the theft were $375,000. Since $369,000 was actually on hand, a preliminary estimate of the theft loss is only $6,000.
