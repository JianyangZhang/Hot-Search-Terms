PREFACE

PREFACE
Regulatory Framework for Financial Institutions – a Zambian Perspective introduces, illustrates, and discusses the many aspects of financial institution regulation. This book is unique in that it explains how all the different segments of financial markets are regulated. It first introduces the financial system and explains the various boundaries that exist within the financial system. This book is also rich on financial institution regulation theory as it explains objectives, principles and tools for financial institution regulation. It also uses the Zambian legal framework to explain how various institutions like banks, insurance companies, security markets and pension funds are formed, regulated and dissolved. The main purpose of this book is to explain the structure and purpose of the financial system from a regulatory perspective, explain the theories and objectives of financial institution regulation, examine the principles of financial institution regulation, explain the structure of regulation of financial markets in Zambia, give an understanding on the formation, operations and winding up of major types of financial institutions and to examine the prevention of financial crime and money laundering . This book is intended for undergraduate and post graduate scholars taking courses such as Banking Law, Business Law, Regulatory Framework for financial institution or any other related subjects. It can also act as a guide for students taking courses such as “Insurance”, “Banking Operations” and “Money and Capital Markets”. This book can also be of interest to investors wishing to set up financial institutions in developing countries whose law is based on the British law. It can also be used by researchers in the field of financial institution regulation.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

1	 OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
1.1	INTRODUCTION
This introductory chapter explores the roles and contributions that different types of financial institutions make to the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy. This Chapter discusses the following: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 Structure of the financial system Financial Markets Financial Market promises Financial Market Participants financial system boundaries

1.2	 STRUCTURE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Financial Systems The financial system of a country can be defined as a collection of financial institutions, regulatory framework and financial market infrastructure that enables financial resources to move from individuals and companies with surplus resources to those with deficit ones. The overall contribution of the financial system to the economy is that of channeling or converting savings into investments. Financial systems consist of markets and participants: Markets A market in any economy provides for goods and services to be exchanged or traded. Financial Markets can be defined as the economic relationship between buyers and sellers with regards to the buying and selling of financial instruments. In financial markets, instruments that are traded can be characterized as promises because any financial claim can be viewed as a promise to deliver specified payments at specified times, under specified circumstances. The promises traded in financial markets can be classified into 4 generic types: a)	 Debt promises. b)	Equity promises. c)	 Contingent promises. d)	Derivate promises.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

a)	 Debt promises – involve promises to pay fixed kwacha amounts at fixed dates in the future. Debt promises include: deposits, government treasury bills, commercial paper, corporate bonds, mortgages, loans etc. b)	 Equity promises – are claims over the residual earnings of a business. Equity promises include common stock, partly paid shares and preference shares. c)	 Contingent promises – are promises to make specified payments under specified circumstances. Contingent promises include all forms of insurance, warranties and guarantees. d)	 Derivative promises – are promises to enter into transactions involving physical commodities, debt or equity promises at a future point in time at prices determined at the time of entering the derivative contract, e.g. options, futures, swap, forwards. Participants Participants of both the local and international financial markets include households, business entities, Central governments and their agents, international financial organizations like the World Bank, International Monetary bank etc. A broader perspective of financial market participants would also include regulators such as the Bank of Zambia, Securities Exchange Commission, Insurance and Pensions Authority, Basel Committee on Bank Supervision etc. For the purpose of this book, it will be helpful to classify institutions by the services they provide: i.	 Deposit taking institutions. ii.	 Risk pooling institutions. iii.	Contractual savings institutions. iv.	Market makers. v.	 Specialized sectoral financers. vi.	Financial service providers. i.	 Deposit taking institutions are institutions that accept demand and fixed term deposits from households, business entities, governments etc. These include: Commercial banks, Building societies, credit union. Commercial banks are the only deposit taking financial institutions that can provide a group of services which include: •	 Taking or accepting deposits from legal entities and citizens; •	 Converting deposits into loans; •	 Debiting or crediting clients’ accounts on their instruction.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

ii.	 Risk pooling institutions are institutions which specialize in providing contingent promises by underwriting economic risks associated with death, illness, damage to or loss of property, and other exposure to loss. Insurance companies are an example of a risk pooling institution. Insurance companies issue contingent liabilities against themselves in the form of insurance policies. Insurance companies can be divided into life insurance and general insurance (non-life or property and casualty insurance). iii.	Contractual savings institutions are vehicles that provide contractual saving services in a fiduciary rather than principal role. Also known as collective investment vehicles, contractual savings institutions invest pooled resources of individuals and firms into a wide range of equity, debt and derivative promises. There are two main types of collective investment vehicles: •	 Open – end mutual funds whose participation is open to anyone. •	 Closed-end mutual funds which are not open to everyone. Pension funds are simply mutual funds that satisfy legislated conditions for retirement savings. Unlike deposit taking institutions, collective vehicles provide equity promises rather than debt promises. iv.	Market makers are participants in financial markets who make secondary markets in securities such as equities, government and corporate debt and derivatives by taking principal positions as buyers and sellers of existing securities. Security dealers include: investment banks, stock brokers and other financial institutions. v.	 Specialized sectoral financers are financial institutions that provide a limited range of financial services to specialized target of promisors and promises. For example, General finance companies raise funds via debt promises from the wholesale finance market and on-lend them to borrowers. Real estate finance companies specialize in channeling funds to home ownership. Leasing companies specialize in providing finance for equipment. The distinguishing characteristic of leasing companies is that they retain ownership of the leased assets. They also benefit from the preferred tax treatment that is often conferred on the investment treatment. In each of the cases, financial institutions provide a highly specialized service that concentrates on informationary efficiency. Their promises are generally of a debt nature, although equity components are not uncommon.

vi.	Financial service providers unlike other financial institutions are service providers that tend not to intermediate between promisors and promisees. They rather provide their services on a fee-for-service basis in form of advice, brokering etc. This group includes: specialized securities brokers, Mortgage brokers, management consultants, and investment advisors.

1.3	 FINANCIAL SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
Many economists argue that boundaries between the insurance industry, banking sector, pension industry and the securities market no longer exist because financial institutions belonging to these separate different industries are increasingly engaging in each other’s activities as competition grows and the appetite to make profits increase. However it should be noted that these boundaries continue to exist because you find different regulators for each category of financial institutions in many countries including Zambia. Table 1.2 below outlines the difference between these institutions.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: A ZAMBIAN PERSPECTIVE

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

All financial institutions sell instruments that fall under any of the two categories of Finance and Credit. Financial instruments are characterized by a one way movement of resources with the second movement depending on the occurrence of certain circumstances. For example, when insurance companies sell insurance to a car owner, the owner of the car pays the insurance company a premium. Money moves from the insured to the insurance company. The money will only go back to the insured from the insurance company in the event that something stipulated under the insurance contract occurs to the car otherwise, the insurance company will keep the premium as profit. In the credit category for example, it is mandatory for money to move two ways. First, the lender (bank) gives the borrower a loan. The borrower is mandated to pay back both the principal and the interest at stipulated times to the lender. The same is true for bonds, treasury bills, leases and even commercial paper. For equity that falls under the finance category, the investor gives a company their money in form of investments into that company. The condition for that investor receiving back their money is when the company makes a profit and the company pays out dividends. The other option is for the investor to sell their shares on the stock market provided there are people willing to buy those shares.

2.1	INTRODUCTION
Regulation of financial institutions remains one of the most important tools for safeguarding economic stability in any country’s economy.

2.2	 THE PRICIPLES OF REGULATION
Definition of regulation A regulation is a rule designed to control the conduct of those to whom it applies. Regulations are fundamentally rules of behavior. Regulations of financial institutions therefore are rules that are designed to control bank and non bank financial institutions’ conducts. Regulations of financial institutions differ between countries; nonetheless, the main objective of regulation is to control activities taking place in a country’s financial market.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: A ZAMBIAN PERSPECTIVE

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

Principles of financial institution regulation The regulatory principles followed by regulators of financial institutions in different countries include: i.	 Role of management: regulatory measures on the senior management of the financial institutions so that they do not take decisions that are detrimental to the financial market. ii.	 Innovation: innovation should be facilitated with restriction so that the financial products and services launched are compliant to the rules and regulations. iii.	International aspects: strict monitoring should be there to see whether the internal standards are maintained or not. iv.	Efficiency and economy: the financial resources of a country should be used in the most prudent and effective way. v.	 Proportionality: the financial regulations that are imposed should be proportional to the advantages that are anticipated from the regulations. vi.	Competition: there should be strict supervision on the financial market for the purpose of minimizing harmful effects of competition.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: A ZAMBIAN PERSPECTIVE

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

2.3	 REGULATORY STRUCTURE
The regulatory framework for financial institutions has four main components: 1. Regulatory objectives There exist different theories relating to regulatory framework objectives. Merton (1990) stated that, regulation is fundamentally about promotion of economic efficiency since the core function of the financial system is to facilitate the allocation and deployment of economic resources. Conventional wisdom recognises that while theory may identify economic efficiency as the overriding objective of financial regulation, in practice regulators usually attempt to achieve multiple objectives; for example, Herring and Santomero (1999) identified four broad objectives for financial regulation which include: a)	 Safeguarding the system against systemic risk. b)	Protecting consumers against opportunistic behavior by suppliers of financial services. c)	 Enhancing the efficiency of the financial system. d)	Achieving a range of social objectives, e.g., increasing homeownership or channeling resources to particular sectors of the economy or population. Against the 4 objectives, Herring and Santormero outlined a rage of measures or tools that regulators use in th`eir efforts to meet objectives. The measures include: Antitrust/competition policy, disclosure standards, conduct of business rules, conflict of interest rules, capital adequacy standards, fit and proper entry tests, Liquidity requirements, reporting requirements, Restrictions on services, deposit insurance, Asset restrictions, Reserve requirements, etc. Another view of regulatory framework objectives known as the alternative framework acknowledges that financial markets work effectively although some failures can exist hence regulation exists only to reduce market failures. In broad terms according to this alternative framework, financial markets fail to produce efficient, competitive outcomes because of the following reasons: a)	 Anticompetitive behaviour. b)	Market misconduct. c)	 Information asymmetry. d)	Systemic instability.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: A ZAMBIAN PERSPECTIVE

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

a)	 Anticompetitive behaviour Market forces are the main determinant of competition. The role of competition regulation is to ensure that market forces operate effectively and are not circumvented by market participants. The following key measures are used in competition policy: •	 Rules designed to deal with the structure of industries e.g. merger or antitrust laws. •	 Rules designed to prevent anticompetitive behavior such as collusion. •	 Rules designed to ensure that markets remain contestable (by ensuring that there is relatively free entry and exit). b)	 Market misconduct The two areas of misconduct in financial markets are fraudulent conduct by market participants and inadequate disclosure on which to base investment decisions. Regulation to address these sources of market failure is usually referred to as market integrity regulation. Market integrity focuses on the following: •	 Disclosure of information. •	 Conduct of business rules, e.g., prohibiting insider trading, market manipulation, false and misleading advertising. •	 Entry restrictions through licensing. •	 Governance and fiduciary responsibilities. •	 Some conditions of minimal financial strength like capital requirements. c)	 Information Asymmetry Information asymmetry arises where products or services are sufficiently complex that disclosure by itself is insufficient to enable consumers to make informed choices. It arises when one party has more information than the other. The form of regulation for asymmetric information counteracting is referred to as prudential regulation. Prudential regulation is an appropriate legal framework for financial operations aimed at preventing or minimizing financial sector problems. Prudential or preventive regulation involves the imposition of prescriptive rules or standards governing the prudential behavior of financial institutions making certain types of promises. These rules may be directed at specific areas of concern or directed more towards minimizing the risk that financial institutions may be unable to honor the financial promises that they have made.

Most modern prudential regulators use the following measures: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 Entry requirements; Capital requirements; Balance sheet restrictions, e.g., reserve requirement; Restrictions on associations among financial institutions; Liquidity requirements; Accountability requirements; Customer support schemes such as deposit insurance and industry guarantee funds.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

d)	 Systemic instability The fourth main source of market failure is systemic instability. Systemic instability arises where failure of one institution to honour its promises leads to a general panic as individuals fear that similar promises made by other institutions may also be dishonored. The primary defense against systemic instability is the maintenance of a sustainable macroeconomic environment with reasonable price stability in both product and asset markets. Measures used to combat systemic instability include both macroeconomic and prudential measures, lenders-of-last-resort facility and direct regulation of the payment systems. Lender of last resort facility provides an external source of liquidity funding to the financial system. Regulation of the payment systems enables proper per settlements among banks, settlement of securities, settlements of foreign exchange etc. 2. Regulatory structure The regulatory structure discusses the models or structures of agencies that carry delegated regulatory responsibilities of the community. There are two different models of regulatory structure: a)	 Institution based regulatory structure: involves the establishment of separate agencies to regulate different institutional groups. b)	 Function based regulatory structure: involves the establishment of separate agencies to regulate different sources of market failure. a)	 Institutional based model The traditional approach to regulation has been institutional, assigning separate agencies to each of the prudentially regulated institutional groups such as banks, insurance companies, securities dealers and in some cases pension’s funds. In this model, the institutional regulator is responsible for: •	 Regulating the prudential behavior of the institutions in its group. •	 Regulating their market conduct. •	 Competition regulation.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: A ZAMBIAN PERSPECTIVE

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

The challenges facing the institutional based model include among others: i.	 The emergence of financial conglomerates in which bank and non bank institutions establish conglomerate company structures or group of companies. The holding company structures that controls the subsidiaries become difficult to regulate. ii.	 Regulatory arbitrage where different institutional regulators cannot coordinate to regulate financial institutions with overlapping operations. Responses to the challenges of conglomerates and regulatory arbitrage have seen the emergency of 3 main regulatory models: •	 The lead regulator model •	 The integrated institutional regulator model •	 The functional regulator model (which is the Function based regulatory structure). Lead regulator model: This model calls for one institutional regulator who takes responsibility for the group as a whole as well as coordinating amongst the regulators involved, thereby becoming the defacto conglomerate regulator. Integrated regulator model: This model calls for the covering of a wide range of regulatory structures that combine all prudential regulation, market conduct regulation and systemic regulation under one roof. The integrated regulator institution (also called super regulator), minimizes regulatory arbitrage. Singapore is one such country with a super regulator for all institutions – the Monetary Authority of Singapore. b)	 The functional regulator model (Function based regulatory structure): This form of regulation is in response to the four sources of market failure, which calls for separate regulators: •	 •	 •	 •	 one one one one for for for for competition; market conduct; asymmetric information; systemic stability.

The distinguishing feature for this model is that each regulator regulates a single function regardless of the institutions involved. For example, the competition regulator is responsible for competition issues for banks, insurance companies and security dealers as well as for all other sectors in the economy. Austria is the only country to adopt this model in full.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

Selecting the appropriate regulatory structure There is no ideal regulatory structure that fits all financial systems. Where financial systems are largely bank based, the lead regulator model is appropriate because the regulator is unlikely able to face institutional blurring. Where financial systems have bank and nonbank institutions with overlapping operations, the integrated model is most appropriate. 3. Regulatory backing Regulatory effectiveness refers to how well and how cost effectively the regulator of a particular intermediary group meets its objective of counteracting market failure. There are two issues that effectiveness of regulation depends on: i.	 The backing or support available to the regulator. ii.	 Regulatory implementation.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: A ZAMBIAN PERSPECTIVE

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

Regulatory backing The critical support issues that affect a regulators capacity to function effectively includes: political support, appropriate legislation backing, adequate funding, appropriate skills and appropriate review process. These backing requirements constitute a set of preconditions for effective regulation. Political support: It is fundamentally important that government and regulators share a common philosophy. This means that: •	 Sharing a common view about roles and objectives of regulation. •	 Keeping open the channels of communications so government is aware of issues facing the regulator. •	 Having clear lines of responsibility and accountability between the regulator and the government. Legislative backing: The fundamental backing that any regulator needs is the legal power to carry out its functions effectively. The powers required by a regulator to meet its objectives may vary according to nature of the market failure involved. For legislative backing of a regulator whose primary focus is market integrity, the powers include: •	 Regulate disclosure for securities and retail investment products; •	 Regulate market conduct to promote orderly and efficient price discovery, trading and securities settlements; •	 Determine the incensing and oversight conditions of financial institutions and organized exchanges; •	 Regulate investment advice and market participants; •	 Regulate the establishment and compliance of collective investment schemes; •	 Regulate the conduct dealings with consumers and the prevention of fraud; •	 Take injunctive action against the operations of suspected fraud; •	 Seize and dispose of assets acquired by fraud; •	 Approve and oversee industry codes of conduct; •	 Delegate accreditation and disciplinary functions to self-regulatory bodies where appropriate; •	 Set benchmarks for the performance of self-regulatory bodies.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

The legislative backing for a regulator whose primary focus is competition regulation typically includes the following powers: •	 •	 •	 •	 Establish rules dealing with the competitive structure of industries; Prevent mergers of financial institutions; Force divestiture where industry concentration becomes uncompetitive; Prohibit collusion on the price or nature of promises made by financial institutions.

With prudential regulation, the cost of market failure due to asymmetric information needs effective power of enforcement which includes: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 To To To To To To To inspect; request information; direct; remove directors and auditors; suspend operations; appoint an administrator; transfer engagements.

Funding: A fundamental precondition for effectiveness is adequate funding. Without adequate resources, the regulator will be unable to attract staff, undertake inspections etc. There are two main models for funding regulatory agencies: i.	 Allocating resources to the regulator through the government’s budget. Advantage Imposes the cost of regulation on tax payers who are the beneficiaries of regulation. Disadvantage Regulators are forced to compete with social programs for funding in every budget. ii.	 Recovering the cost of regulation from industry levy. Advantage It removes regulator’s funding from budget process hence creating consistency in funding. Disadvantage The cost of regulation falls not on the beneficiaries but not on the regulated industry itself. Skill base – An effective regulator requires sound regulatory culture among its staff and an appropriate set of skills to deal with extremely complex issues.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

Regular review – The most important steps that can be taken towards maintaining an appropriate balance between effectiveness and efficiency are to include efficiency as an explicit objective in the regulators charter and to mandate a process of periodic reviews possibly including representatives from the regulator the industry and the government. 4. Regulatory implementation Regulatory effectiveness depends both on the backing available to the regulator and the methods or tools used by the regulator to implement its regulatory powers and responsibilities. Tools used by the regulator can be broken down into 4 main categories: i.	 Preconditions for entry into the market (licensing ownership restrictions and capital requirements). ii.	 Ongoing conditions for continued participation in the industry (market structure requirements, liquidity requirements etc.). iii.	Surveillance methods (complaint mechanisms, monitoring, inspectors). iv.	Enforcement practices (prosecution, problem resolution, support schemes).

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

i. Preconditions for entry There are three tools used for implementation in this category: Licensing Licensing is the most basic form of entry restriction and provides a minimum level of assurance to consumers of institutions services that institutions will not take advantage of them through manipulation of the institutions’ activities. Licenses safeguard by providing traceable record of the firm’s location, owners and management. Licensing restricts through the following: •	 Requiring professional qualifications or accreditation of staff and management; •	 Requiring a detailed business plan; •	 Requiring enforceable undertakings by directors with respect to certain actions or situations; •	 Requiring the license holder to submit to various forms of ongoing regulation; •	 Imposing “fit and proper” tests on directors, management or staff; •	 Imposing ownership restrictions, including limiting or prohibiting the issue of licenses to certain groups; •	 Imposing minimum size restrictions. Ownership restrictions As a form of entry requirement, ownership restrictions are often imposed as a means of counteracting the anticompetitive effects of the other elements of entry restrictions particularly in the case of high – intensity promises. Many countries for example restrict the issue of banking licenses to institutions that do not hold other financial service licenses; others prohibit the issue of licenses to foreign entities. Some counties limit ownership of a financial institution by a single regulator (so that one bank is not controlled by a small group to benefit themselves). Some countries limit direct shareholding by commercial enterprises.

OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGULATION

Capital requirements Capital requirements generally take one of the two forms: -- Minimum size requirements (they save as a deterrent to fraud by putting a high cost on the loss of a license); -- Variable capital adequacy requirements (to absorb unexpected losses). ii. Ongoing regulatory requirements These requirements include continuous observance of license conditions, including any ownership and capital requirements. Additional ongoing regulatory tools include: 1.

9.	 Liquidity requirements: These are requirements designed to ensure that a regulated institution has funds available to meet any undertakings it has made concerning the liquidity of its promises. 10.	 Accountability requirements: These are requirements that usually take the form of restricting on the valuation of assets and liabilities. iii. Surveillance In addition to establishing rules of behaviour, regulators need to monitor industry’s compliance with the rules. There are 3 basic methods for monitoring compliance with rules: 1.	 Consumer complaints mechanisms; 2.	 Off-site monitoring; 3.	 On-site inspections. 1.	 Consumer complaints mechanism is least intrusive and less costly approach to surveillance and relies on direct complaints by consumers. 2.	 Off-site monitoring – involves statistical and other reviews of data provided by the regulated institutions. The general objective of off-site analyses is to detect deterioration in an institutions financial position by comparing its current position to its historical experience and to that of its peer. Some prudential regulators use statistical techniques including linear regression, logit and and probit analysis, discriminant analysis, and even artificial neural networks to detect the probability of financial distress. 3.	 Inspections – on-site inspections are a time and resource intensive way of testing an institution’s compliance with regulations. There are two types of approaches used in on-site inspections: •	 United States Approach – in which large teams of inspectors spend long periods of time sifting through a comprehensive review of most areas of regulatory compliance. •	 British Approach – where small teams spend relatively short periods of time reviewing specific issues identified by off-site analysis.

CENTRAL BANK REGULATION

3.2	 RATIONALE FOR CENTRAL BANK REGULATION
Definitions of Central Bank A Central Bank is a generic term given to a country’s primary monetary authority. It is the entity responsible for overseeing the monetary system of a nation (or group of nations in the case of the European Union) and has a wide range of responsibilities such as issuing currency, regulating the credit system, managing exchange reserves etc. Rationale for Central Bank regulation There are two classic arguments for Central Bank regulation: 1.	 First, Central Bank regulation protects small and unsophisticated depositors. Given their small size and fragmentation, individual depositors do not have the ability to monitor whether bank managers are acting prudently and on their behalf. The regulator in such cases represents the depositors. Capital regulation and the requirement to inject new capital when necessary or face closure may be a way to create the incentives present in non-financial firms for managers to act on behalf of shareholders. 2.	 The second rationale stems from the need to protect the payments systems and the financial systems more generally. For example, on certain occasions, otherwise solvent banks may be subject to pure liquidity runs. If depositors run against a weak bank, they may also run against a healthier bank in the system, in what is known as contagion. One way to prevent such runs is for the Central Bank to promise liquidity to solvent banks – that is for the Central Bank to provide lender of last resort services. Central Bank Independence Central Bank independence can be defined as the Central Bank’s operational and management independence from government. There are many arguments regarding the rationale for Central Bank independence. The first school of thought against Central Bank independence postulates that too much freedom given to a Central Bank can lead to its inability to perform regulatory functions because: •	 Freedom (independence) puts too much power in the hands of unelected Central Bank directors; •	 Independence has no provision to replace bad directors; •	 Independence makes it difficult to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy as the Central Bank and parliament can have different agendas.

CENTRAL BANK REGULATION

The school of thought in favour of the Central Bank’s independence posits the following reasons: •	 Politicians may lack the economic expertise of bankers; •	 The Minister of Finance may pressure the Central Bank to buy new treasury bills financed by printing new money (common in third world countries); •	 Since the Central Bank does not worry about re-election, it can pursue unpopular but wise policies. There are four types of Central Bank Independence: 1.	 Operational Independence – provides the Central Bank the right to determine the best way of achieving its policy goals, including the types of instruments used and the timing of their use. This is the most common form of Central Bank independence. 2.	 Legal Independence – is the independence of the Central Bank backed and defined by law. In democratic states, this type of independence is limited because the Central Bank is accountable at some level to government and parliament. 3.	 Management Independence – provides the Central Bank the authority to run its own operations like appointing staff without excessive involvement of the government. 4.	 Goal Independence – provides the Central Bank the right to set its own policy goals, whether inflation targeting, control of money supply, or maintaining a fixed exchange rate. While this type of independence is more common, Central Banks prefer to announce their policy goals in partnership with the appropriate government departments. This helps avoid situations where monetary and fiscal policy are in conflict.

3.2	 CENTRAL BANKING AROUND THE WORLD
For hundreds of years, central banks have been evolving in their assigned tasks, their relationship to the state, their interaction with financial market participants, and their internal management and decision-making processes. The world’s oldest existing central bank, Sweden’s Riksbank, opened its doors in 1668. The Bank of England began operating in 1694. But although evolution of central banking is nothing new, the past two decades have seen enormous changes in central banks and their practices, especially in reforms of how those banks are governed. The reforms have differed across countries. In some countries like the United Kingdom, for example, older institutions have been fundamentally restructured. In other countries, entirely new central banks have been established. For instance, since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, central banks have been created in countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. In Europe, the member countries of the European Union created a supranational central bank that oversees a monetary union. In all of these situations, central bank law was either revised or re-written while institutional objectives, practices, and structures were amended or created from scratch. The following are some of the major Central Banks around the world:

CENTRAL BANK REGULATION

-- U.S. Federal Reserve System (The Fed) The Federal Reserve is probably the most influential central bank in the world. With the U.S. dollar being on the other side of approximately 90% of all currency transactions, the Fed›s sway has a sweeping effect on the valuation of many currencies. The group within the Fed that decides on interest rates is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of seven governors of the  Federal Reserve Board  plus five presidents of the 12 district reserve banks. The Fed’s mandate is to maintain long term price stability and sustainable growth. -- European Central Bank (ECB) The European Central Bank was established in 1999. The Governing Council of the ECB is the group that decides on changes to monetary policy. The Council consists of the six members of the executive board of the ECB, plus the governors of all the national central banks from the 12 euro area countries. As a central bank, in planning on making changes to interest rates, the ECB will generally give the market ample notice by warning of an impending move through comments to the press. The mandate of the ECB is to maintain price stability and sustainable growth. However, unlike the Fed, the ECB strives to maintain the annual growth in consumer prices below 2%. As an export dependent economy, the ECB also has a vested interest in preventing against excess strength in its currency because this poses a risk to its export market. -- Bank of England (BoE) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England is a nine-member committee consisting of a governor, two deputy governors, two executive directors and four outside experts. The Bank of England is frequently touted as one of the most effective central banks in the world. Its mandate is to maintain monetary and financial stability. The BoE’s monetary policy mandate is to keep prices stable and to maintain confidence in the currency. To accomplish this, the central bank has an inflation target of 2%. If prices breach that level, the central bank will look to curb inflation, while a level far below 2% will prompt the central bank to take measures to boost inflation. -- Bank of Japan (BoJ) The Bank of Japan’s Monetary Policy Committee consists of the BoJ Governor, two deputy governors and six other members. Because Japan is very dependent on exports, the Bank of Japan has an even more active interest than the European Central Bank does in preventing an excessively strong currency. The central bank has been known to come into the open market to artificially weaken its currency by selling it against U.S. dollars and euros. The Bank of Japan is also extremely vocal when it feels concerned about excess currency volatility and strength. The main mandate of the Bank of Japan is to maintain price stability and to ensure stability of the financial system, which makes inflation the central bank’s top focus.

CENTRAL BANK REGULATION

-- Swiss National Bank (SNB) The Swiss National Bank has a three-person committee that makes decisions on interest rates. Unlike most other central banks, the Swiss National Bank determines the interest rate band rather than a specific target rate. Like Japan and the euro zone, Switzerland is also very export dependent, which means that the Swiss National Bank also does not have an interest in seeing its currency become too strong. Therefore, its general bias is to be more conservative with rate hikes. The SNB’s mandate is to ensure price stability while taking the economic situation into account. -- Bank of Canada (BoC) Monetary policy decisions within the Bank of Canada are made by a consensus vote in the Governing Council, which consists of the Bank of Canada Governor, the senior deputy governor and four deputy governors. The mandate of the BoC is maintaining the integrity and value of the currency. The central bank has an inflation target of 1–3%, and it has done a good job of keeping inflation within that band since 1998. -- Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) The Reserve Bank of Australia’s Monetary Policy Committee consists of the central bank governor, the deputy governor, the secretary to the treasurer and six independent members appointed by the government. The mandate of the RBA is to ensure stability of currency, maintenance of full employment and economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. The central bank has an inflation target of 2–3% per year. -- Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Unlike other central banks, decision-making power on monetary policy ultimately rests with the central bank governor. The mandate of the RBNZ is to maintain price stability and to avoid instability in output, interest rates and exchange rates. The RBNZ has an inflation target of 1.5%. It focuses hard on this target, because failure to meet it could result in the dismissal of the governor of the RBNZ.

COMMERCIAL BANK REGULATION

4.2	 OVERVIEW OF COMMERCIAL BANKING
A bank is a financial institution that performs all of the following three (3) main functions: •	 Accepts deposits from the public; •	 Provides loans from depositors’ money to the public; and •	 Performs financial transactions on depositors’ accounts on behalf of and on the instructions of the depositors. As depository institutions, significant proportions of commercial bank funds come from customer deposits. Commercial banks play a key role in the transmission of monetary policy for the central bank to the rest of the economy. There are various types of commercial banks. The necessity for the variety among these banks is because each bank is specialized in their own field. Each bank has its own principles and policies. Different rates of interests are also noted among commercial banks. The different types of banks are listed as below: Savings Banks: These are financial institutions whose primary purpose is accepting savings deposits and paying interest on those deposits. Savings banks are suited for employees with a monthly salary. Low waged people may open an account in the savings bank. Commercial Banks: These are banks whose main business is deposit-taking and making loans.  Commercial banks accumulate deposits from different individuals and corporations with the aim of extending the same as loan to households and corporations to make profits from interest. Industrial Development Bank: These are banks that are committed towards enhancing the growth of industries by providing loans for a very long period of time. This is vital for the long term growth of the industries. Land Development Bank: These are banks that promote growth in the food sector by giving loans to farmers at a relatively lower interest rate. These loans are normally provided with land acting as collateral. Mortgage Banks: These are banks that specialize in providing mortgages. Federal or National Banks: These are banks that control the principles and policies of other banks across the country. These banks are managed and run by the government. These banks provide benchmarks which other banks should follow.

Offshore Banks: These are banks that operate in countries whose banking system provides complete freedom from domestic laws. Internet Bank: These are banks that provide banking services via the internet. Investment Banks: These are banks that provident investment banking services. Universal Banks: These are banks that perform a wide spectrum of financial services. Islamic Banks – These banks whose operations are based on the principles of the religion Islam.

4.3	 OBJECTIVES OF COMMERCIAL BANK REGULATION
In every country, commercial banks are regulated so as to provide safeguards for investors in and customers of banks and financial institutions and to provide for matters connected with or incidental to the foregoing. Commercial banks in Zambia are regulated by the Bank of Zambia under the “Banking and Financial services Act of 1994”. Licensing of Banks and Financial Institutions One of the ways in which the Bank of Zambia regulates commercial bank is through licensing. Licensing helps the BoZ to properly scrutinize banks willing to enter the market hence safeguarding the interests of depositors. Companies not meeting the conditions set by BoZ are not allowed to offer banking services. This also helps BoZ keep an optimal number of banks to operate in the financial system. Too many banks can bring in efficiency because: 1.	 High liquidity in banking sector encourages subprime lending. 2.	 Too many banks come with unhealthy competition which leads to market “over flooding”. Over flooding brings about reduced profits and bank failures. 3.	 Too many banks can bring in new attractive products which can cause a loan crisis in the economy, e.g., too many credit card overdrafts can lead to a high indebtness among citizens for example the USA mortgage crisis of 2008.

Too few banks can lead to: 1.	 Reduced innovation in the banking sector because of luck of competition. 2.	 Reduced financial inclusion due to banks not being able to cope with the demand for banking services. 3.	 Increase lending rates which can affect economic growth etc.

4.4	 FORMATION AND REGISTRATION OF COMMERCIAL BANKS

4.5	 PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION OF COMMERCIAL BANKS
For prudential regulation, the following are the provisions relating to banks and other nonbank financial institutions: a) Reserves A bank or financial institution shall maintain a reserve account and before declaring any dividend shall transfer to its reserve account, out of the net profits of each year after due provision has been made for taxation, the minimum amount prescribed by the Bank of Zambia. The Bank of Zambia may by regulation prescribe the amount required to be transferred to the reserve account, the method of computing that amount, the form of the reserve account and any other matter it considers necessary to give effect to this section. No bank or financial institution shall declare credit or pay any dividend or make any other transfer from surplus if to do so would result in an impairment of the capital adequacy requirements of the Banking Act. The Bank of Zambia may permit a reduction of the reserve account when the relevant payment or transfer is made for the purpose of increasing the capital, and when the Bank of Zambia is satisfied that is the only practicable means of preventing an impairment of the bank’s or financial institution’s capital or of enabling the bank or financial institution to make provisions that the Bank of Zambia considers to be necessary.

4.8	 INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF COMMERCIAL BANK REGULATION
When banking systems in a number of industrial countries weakened in the late 1980s, pressure developed for harmonizing bank regulation among industrial countries, at least for large internationally active banks in these countries. Prior to 1988, bank regulators tended to regulate bank capital by setting minimum levels for the ratio of capital to total assets. However, definitions of capital and the ratios considered acceptable varied from country to country. Some countries enforced their regulations more diligently than other countries. Increasingly, banks were competing globally, and a bank operating in a country where capital regulations were slack was considered to have a competitive edge over one operating in a country with tighter and more strictly enforced capital regulations. In addition, the huge exposures of the major international banks to less developed countries such as Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as the accounting games sometimes used for those exposures, were starting to raise questions about the adequacy of capital levels.

COMMERCIAL BANK REGULATION

Another problem was that the types of transaction entered into by bank were becoming more complicated. The over-the-counter derivatives market for product such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and foreign exchange options was growing fast. These contracts increase the credit risks being taken by a bank. Consider, for example, an interest rate swap. If the counterparty in the interest rate swap transaction defaults when the swap has a positive value to the bank and a negative value to the counterparty, the bank is liable to lose money. Many of these newer transactions were “off balance sheet”. This means that they had no effect on the level of assets reported by a bank. As a result, they had no effect on the level of assets reported by a bank. As a result, they had no effect on the amount of capital the bank was required to keep. It became apparent to regulators that total assets were no longer a good indicator of the total risks being taken. A more sophisticated approach than that of setting minimum levels for the ratio of capital to total balance-sheet assets was needed. The design of the cross border or transnational regulations was delegated to a newly established Basel Committee on Bank Supervision. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision consists of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. It usually meets at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, where its permanent Secretariat is located. Basel I The 1988 BIS Accord was the first attempt to set international risk-based standards for capital adequacy. It has been subject to much criticism as being too simple and somewhat arbitrary. In fact, the Accord was a huge achievement. It was signed by all 12 members of the Basel Committee and paved the way for significant increases in the resources banks devote to measuring, understanding, and managing risks. The BIS Accord defined two requirements that bank capital had to satisfy. The first was that the ratio of a bank’s assets to its capital had to be less than 20. This requirement was similar to that existing prior to 1988 in many countries. The second requirement involves what is known as the Cooke ratio. For most banks there was no problem in satisfying the capital multiple requirements. The Cooke ratio was the key regulatory requirement.

The Cooke Ratio In calculating the Cooke ratio, both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items are considered. They are used to calculate what is known as the bank’s total risk-weighted assets (also sometimes referred to as the risk-weighted amount). It is a measure of the bank’s total credit exposure.
Risk weight (%) 0 Asset category Cash, gold bullion, claims on OECD governments such as Treasury bonds or insured residential mortgages.

The capital had two components: 1.	 Tier 1 capital. This consists of items such as equity and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock net of goodwill. 2.	 Tier 2 capital. This is sometimes referred to as supplementary capital. It includes instruments such as cumulative perpetual preferred stock, certain types of 99 year debenture issues, and subordinated debt (i.e., debt subordinated to depositors) with an original life of more than five years. The 1996 Amendment In 1995, the Basel Committee issued a consultative proposal to amend the 1988 Accord. This became known as the “1996 Amendment”. It was implemented in 1998 and was then sometimes referred to as “BIS 98”. The amendment involves keeping capital for assets and liabilities that are held for trading.

Basel II In June 1999, the Basel Committee proposed new rules that have become known as Basel II. These were revised in January 2001 and April 2003. A number of Quantitative Impact Studies (QISs) were carried out to test application of the new rules and the amount of capital that will be required. A final set of rules agreed to by all members of the Basel committee was published in June 2004. This was update in November 2005. Implementation of the rules began in 2007 after a further QIS. The Basel II capital requirements apply to internationally active banks. In the United States, there are many small regional banks and the US regulatory authorities have decided that Basel II will not apply to them (these banks are regulated under what is termed Basel IA, which is similar to Basel I). Some of the larger regional banks are voluntarily implementing Basel II, possibly to signal to their shareholders that they manage risks in a sophisticated way. In Europe, all banks, large or small, are regulated under Basel II. Furthermore, the European Union requires the Basel II rules to be applied to securities companies as well as banks. Basel II is based on three pillars: 1.	 Minimum capital requirements 2.	 Supervisory review 3.	 Market discipline In Pillar 1 the minimum capital requirement for credit risk in the banking book is calculated in a new way that reflects the credit ratings of counterparties. The capital requirement for market risk remains unchanged from the 1996 Amendment and there is a new capital charge for operational risk. The general requirement in Basel I that banks hold a total capital equal to 8% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) remains unchanged. When the capital requirement for a risk is calculated in a way that does not involve RWAs, it is multiplied by 12.5 to convert it to an RWA. As a result, it is always the case that:

Pillar 2, which is concerned with the supervisory review process, allows regulators in different countries some discretion in how rules are applied (so that they can take account of local conditions), but seeks to achieve overall consistency in the application of the rules. It places more emphasis on early intervention when problems arise. Supervisors are required to do far more than just ensuring that the minimum capital required under Basel II is held. Part of their role is to encourage banks to develop and use better risk management techniques and to evaluate these techniques. They should evaluate risks that are not covered by Pillar 1 enter into an active dialogue with banks when deficiencies are identified. Pillar 3, market discipline, requires banks to disclose more information about the way they allocate capital and the risks they take. The idea here is that banks will be subjected to added pressure to make sound risk management decisions if shareholders and potential shareholders have more information about those decisions. Credit risk capital under Basel II For credit risk, banks have three choices under Basel II: 1.	 The standardized approach 2.	 The foundation internal ratings based (IRB) approach 3.	 The Advanced IRB approach For the standardized approach, risk weights are largely a function of external ratings.

Basel III One of the main reasons the economic and financial crisis, which began in 2007, became so severe was that, the banking sectors of many countries had built up excessive on and offbalance sheet leverage. This was accompanied by a gradual erosion of the level and quality of the capital base. At the same time, many banks were holding insufficient liquidity buffers. The banking system therefore was not able to absorb the resulting systemic trading and credit losses nor could it cope with the reinter mediation of large off-balance sheet exposures that had built up in the shadow banking system. The crisis was further amplified by a procyclical deleveraging process and by the interconnectedness of systemic institutions through an array of complex transactions. During the most severe episode of the crisis, the market lost confidence in the solvency and liquidity of many banking institutions. The weaknesses in the banking sector were rapidly transmitted to the rest of the financial system and the real economy, resulting in a massive contraction of liquidity and credit availability. Ultimately the public sector had to step in with unprecedented injections of liquidity, capital support and guarantees, exposing taxpayers to large losses.

The reforms are expected to raise capital requirements for the trading book and complex securitization exposures, a major source of losses for many internationally active banks. The enhanced treatment introduces a stressed value-at-risk (VaR) capital requirement based on a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress. In addition, the Committee introduced higher capital requirements for so-called resecuritisations in both the banking and the trading book. The reforms also raised the standards of the Pillar 2 supervisory review process and strengthen Pillar 3 disclosures. The Pillar 1 and Pillar 3 enhancements were to be implemented by the end of 2011; the Pillar 2 standards became effective when they were introduced in July 2009. The Committee is also conducting a fundamental review of the trading book. The work on the fundamental review of the trading book is targeted for completion by year-end 2011. It is critical that banks’ risk exposures are backed by a high quality capital base. The crisis demonstrated that, credit losses and write-downs come out of retained earnings, which is part of banks’ tangible common equity base. It also revealed the inconsistency in the definition of capital across jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure that would have enabled the market to fully assess and compare the quality of capital between institutions. To this end, the predominant form of Tier 1 capital must be common shares and retained earnings. This standard is reinforced through a set of principles that also can be tailored to the context of non-joint stock companies to ensure they hold comparable levels of high quality Tier 1 capital. Deductions from capital and prudential filters have been harmonized internationally and generally applied at the level of common equity or its equivalent in the case of non-joint stock companies. The remainders of the Tier 1 capital base must be comprised of instruments that are subordinated, have fully discretionary noncumulative dividends or coupons and have neither a maturity date nor an incentive to redeem. Innovative hybrid capital instruments with an incentive to redeem through features such as step-up clauses, currently limited to 15% of the Tier 1 capital base, will be phased out. In addition, Tier 2 capital instruments will be harmonized and so-called Tier 3 capital instruments, which were only available to cover market risks, eliminated. Finally, to improve market discipline, the transparency of the capital base will be improved, with all elements of capital required to be disclosed along with a detailed reconciliation to the reported accounts.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY REGULATION

5	INSURANCE INDUSTRY REGULATION
5.1	INTRODUCTION
The existence of insurance companies in economies has been necessitated by the existence of risks. Risks for both households and businesses pose a major threat because their occurrence can cause major financial loss. It is therefore important for market players to hedge their risks so as to not only safeguard their assets but also to ensure continuation of steady income inflows after loss has occurred. Because insurance companies are the most common professionals whose purpose is to hedge risks, many businesses and households tend to go to them for risk management. It is therefore very important for governments to regulate insurance companies so as to ensure that insurance companies that manage risks on behalf of others operate in a prudent manner themselves. This chapter provides an understanding of the following: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 Overview of the insurance industry The legal framework and regulatory body for insurance industry regulation Formation and registration of insurers Regulation of management and shareholding of insurers Transfer of insurance business Winding up of insurers

5.2	 OVERVIEW OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY
Insurance companies (Insurers) are businesses that provide coverage in form of compensation resulting from loss, damages, injury, treatment or any other negative occurrence in exchange for premium payments. The  company  calculates  the  risk  of occurrence then determines the cost to replace (pay for) the loss to determine the premium amount. Insurance companies are classified into two categories: i)	 Life insurance companies. These companies offer protection in the event of untimely death, illness and retirement for the insured and their beneficiaries. Life insurance companies are increasingly offering annuity contracts, pension plans and providing accident and health insurance. ii)	General insurance companies. These companies offer protection against injury and liability due to accidents, theft, fire and other catastrophes.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY REGULATION

According to the Pension and Insurance Authority, Zambia’s insurance industry has also been steadily growing from 1971 when the industry became a monopoly under the Zambia State Insurance Corporation following the 1968 Economic Nationalisation Reforms. Therefore, between 1971 and 1991 Zambia only had one insurance company and broker. Following the liberalization of the economy in 1992 the number of insurance companies has significantly increased from 11 in 2008 to 33 in 2015. However the number of insurance brokers has also increased to 39. Zambia currently has two local reinsurance companies, 2 reinsurance brokers, 222 insurance agents and a number of other players. With increased competition has emerged choice of company and products for policy holders and relatively affordable premiums. Players are also being constantly challenged to be innovative and come up with new products that meet the demands of Zambians. Significant  growth has also been recorded in volume of business underwritten and as at December 2014, the volume of general insurance stood at K1,216 billion from K1.022 billion in 2013 (PIA, 2016). On the long term side of insurance, the GWP turnover as at December 2014, stood at K650 million from K450 million in 2013 (PIA, 2016).  The Zambian insurance industry had the following players as at July 31st, 2015: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 2 Reinsurance Companies 2 Reinsurance Brokers 22 General Insurance Companies 11 Long Term Insurance Companies 39 Insurance Brokers (from 48 in 2014) 222 Insurance Agents (from 279 in 2014) 6 Claims Agents 8 Motor Assessors 6 Loss Adjusters 1 Risk Surveyors

5.3	 THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND REGULATORY BODY
The Pensions and Insurance Authority (PIA) is the regulatory and supervisory authority for the pensions and insurance industry in Zambia. It was created by the Pension Scheme Regulation Act of 1996 and the Insurance Act of 1997 as amended in 2005. Prior to the enactment of the Acts in 2005, PIA existed as the office of the registrar of pensions and insurance under the ministry of finance and national planning. After the enactment the PIA became a corporate body.

The main function of pension funds is to provide a stable income to citizens when they are no longer in employment. Pension funds pool resources from citizens with a promise to pay the same citizens after retirement. The fact that pension funds and schemes pool resources from citizens is justification for the government to regulate them so as to ensure that retired workers actually get their money. In simple terms, pension funds help citizens save for retirement.

PENSION FUND REGULATION

6.2	 ROLE OF PENSION FUNDS IN AN ECONOMY
A pension is an arrangement to provide people with an income when they are no longer earning a regular income from employment. A pension fund or scheme is any plan or scheme which provides retirement income. It is a fund established by employers or government to pay retirement benefits to employees. Pension funds are major institutional investors. Pension Funds are pooled contributions from pension plans of employers or organizations set up to provide employee retirement benefits. Functions of Pension funds Pension funds perform the following functions: 1.	 Mobilizing and managing savings of citizens; 2.	 Providing income stability to retired workers; 3.	 Making labour laws more efficient. This implies that social security laws can be put into practice by government because of the availability of funds collected from social security taxes; 4.	 Pension funds are a source of resources for investments as they turn the pooled resources from citisens into investments. Classification of Pension Funds The following is the classification of pension funds: 1.	 Open versus closed pension funds -- An open pension fund is a fund that supports at least one pension plan with no restriction on membership. -- A closed pension funds is a fund that supports only pension plans that are limited to certain employees. Closed pension funds can also be: ----Individual pension fund; Single employer pension fund; Multi employer pension fund; Related member pension fund.

2.	 Public versus private pension funds. -- A public pension funds is one which is regulated under public law; -- A private pension fund is one which is regulated under private sector law.

PENSION FUND REGULATION

Types of Pension Funds The following are the types of pension funds: •	 Pension Fund: This is where two thirds of the final benefit must be paid as pension for the rest of the pensioner’s life and the remaining one third as lamp sum. •	 Provident Fund: This is where the full amount is available at retirement. •	 Retirement Annuity Fund: This is a financial product sold by financial institutions designed to grow funds from an individual then at a later time make streams of payments. •	 Preservation Fund: This is an investment fund which is used as a place to “park” the pension or provident fund payout you get when you resign from your job before reaching normal retirement age. Pension fund investments include conventional securities, such as stocks and bonds, real estate and alternative investments such as hedge funds and structured securities. Pension fund investment portfolios also include financial derivatives.

6.3	 LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR PENSION FUND REGULATION
Pension funds were for a long time unregulated until the Pension Scheme Regulations Act came into being in 1996. The Act is flawed and has a lot of areas that require streamlining. Prior to its enactment, pension schemes were only required to register with Zambia Revenue Authority for tax exemption purposes but their operations were largely unregulated. With the establishment of the PIA, there is now some limited supervision being undertaken albeit ineffectively due to the limited capacity of the regulatory body itself. Areas of conflict exist in the pensions arena, as there are multiple regulators and organs concerned with the management of pension funds. The following are the various acts of parliament that regulate the pension industry: 1.	 Pension Scheme Regulation Act of 1996 № 28 – This Act serves to provide prudential regulation and supervision of all pension schemes except for NAPSA. It has a bearing on both public and private pension schemes. It ensures that they operate in a prudential manner and protects scheme member’s rights and benefits. 2.	 Local Authorities Superannuation Fund Act CAP 286 of 1996 – This Act establishes the local authorities superannuation fund and defines the way it will be managed and all aspects dealing with finance, membership and benefits. Members of this scheme include Local Authorities, ZESCO, water utilities and National Housing Authority.

3.	 Public Service Pension Fund Act of 1996 № 35 – This Act operates in a similar manner as previous act but deals with members of the public service commission, defense forces, teaching service commission, the Judiciary service commission, police and prisons service commission and the Zambia Security and intelligence service. 4.	 National Pension Scheme Act of 1996 № 40 – This Act establishes the National Pension Scheme (NAPSA). NAPSA is a compulsory state scheme for all Zambian citizens in formal employment within Zambia. This Act exempts no one though the Ministry of Finance exercised its power to exempt privatized ZCCM companies. 5.	 Land (Perpetual) Succession Act cap 188 – This establishes a trust through incorporation of a pension scheme into a legally establishes institution through trust deed executed by the trustees of the scheme. This only applies to private occupational pension schemes. 6.	 Income Tax Act cap 323 – This Act affects the entire pension arrangements enacted by acts of parliament. It deals with taxation issues beginning with treatment of the contributions made into the pension scheme by any party concerned, the investment income and the pay outs.

REGULATION OF BUILDING SOCIETIES

7.2	 OVERVIEW OF BUILDING SOCIETIES
A building society is a financial institution that offers savings accounts and mortgages as its main business. A building society is a mutual institution. This means that most people who have a savings account or mortgage are members and have certain rights to vote and receive information as well as to attend and speak at meetings. Each member has a vote regardless of how much they have invested or borrowed. The difference between banks and societies ideally is that banks are companies while societies are not. Building Societies not owned by shareholders but by their members. Because of financial innovation and the need to tighten financial regulation, the boundaries between banks and building societies have been erased. Building societies have increasingly been allowed to perform activities that were in the past reserved only for commercial banks. By their very nature, building societies are supposed to be involved in long-term housing finance and mortgage products such as long-term bonds.

7.3	 FORMATION AND REGISTRATION OF BUILDING SOCIETIES
Regulation In Zambia, building societies are regulated by the Bank of Zambia under the Banking and Financial Services Act of 1994, though they are formed in accordance with the Building Societies Act № 23 as amended in 2005. They are currently three building societies in Zambia namely; Zambia National Building Society formed by an Act of parliament (Building Societies Act of 1968 as amended in 1970), Finance Building Society and Pan African Building Society. Formation and Registration of a building society in Zambia Any number of persons not being less than 5 may establish a building society under the Building Societies Act. The persons willing to set up a building society shall furnish the Registrar of Banks and Financial Institutions with the following: •	 After agreeing upon the rules of governing the society, the stakeholders shall send to the Registrar two copies of rules signed by all persons and secretary an application form in prescribed forms. •	 Each of those persons shall subscribe the minimum subscription fee satisfying the Registrar that the total sum subscribed by way of shores, deposits or negotiated loans is not less than the amount prescribed by BoZ and that the total amount shall remain as fixed term investments with the society for a period not less than 5 years.

CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION

8	 CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION
8.1	INTRODUCTION
Capital Markets are a major source of long term finance for businesses and governments around the world. Capital markets enable market participants invest in large infrastructure projects and also execute other capital expenditure. The fact that capital markets are based on long term funds pooled from citizens and other businesses, there is need for governments to ensure that this segment of the financial market is regulated especially that long term investments can represent life savings for many. This chapter provides an understanding of the following: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 Definitions and nature of capital markets Objectives and principles of capital market regulation Role of corporate governance in capital market regulation Legal framework for securities markets regulation Improper trading practices and the compensation fund Roles of institutions involved in securities market regulation

8.2	 OVERVIEW OF CAPITAL MARKETS
A capital market is a market for securities where business enterprises and governments can raise long term funds. Capital markets are also markets where people, companies, and governments with more funds than they need (because they save some of their income) transfer those funds to people, companies, or governments who have a shortage of funds (because they spend more than their income). Stock equity securities and bond markets are two major capital markets. Capital markets promote economic efficiency by channeling money from those who do not have an immediate productive use for it to those who do. Capital markets carry out the desirable economic function of directing capital to productive uses. The savers (governments, businesses, and people who save some portion of their income) invest their money in capital markets like stocks and bonds. The borrowers (governments, businesses, and people who spend more than their income) borrow the savers’ investments that have been entrusted to the capital markets. When savers make investments, they convert cash or savings (risk-free assets) into risky assets with the hopes of receiving enhanced benefits in the future. Since all investments are risky, the only reason a saver would put cash at risk is if returns on the investment are greater than returns on holding risk-free assets. Buying stocks and bonds and investing in real estate are common examples. The savers hope that the stock, bond, or real estate will “appreciate,” or grow in value.

CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION

Primary and Secondary Capital Markets The primary market is the market in which new securities are issued. Corporations or Central Governments that needs funds issue securities to purchasers in the primary market. Investment banks assist in this issuance process in a process known as underwriting. Underwriting is a process where banks guarantee a minimum price for a business’s securities and sell them to the public. Since the primary market is limited to issuing new securities only, it is of lesser importance than the secondary market. The secondary market includes stock exchanges (like the Lusaka Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Nikkei), bond markets, and futures and options markets, among others. All of these secondary markets deal in the trade of securities. The term “securities” encompasses a broad range of investment instruments. Investors have essentially two broad categories of securities available to them: equity securities (which represent ownership of a part of a company) and debt securities (which represent a loan from the investor to a company or government entity). Savers who purchase debt instruments are creditors. Creditors, or debt holders, receive future income or assets in return for their investment. The most common example of a debt instrument is a bond. When investors buy bonds, they are lending the issuers of the bonds their money. In return, they will receive interest payments (usually at a fixed rate) for the life of the bond and receive the principal when the bond expires. National governments, local governments, global, national, and local companies, and many other types of institutions sell bonds. Stock is the type of equity security with which most people are familiar. When investors (savers) buy stock, they become owners of a “share” of a company’s assets and earnings. If a company is successful, the price that investors are willing to pay for its stock will often rise and shareholders who bought stock at a lower price than stand to make a profit. If a company does not do well, however, its stock may decrease in value and shareholders can lose money. Stock prices are also subject to both general economic and industry-specific market factors. Capital markets in Zambia The importance of a well functioning capital market cannot be overemphasized as it improves financial market efficiency and is the missing link in Zambia’s long quest and search for economic development, sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.

CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION

Prior to the liberalization era, Zambia had no formal capital market. Firms relied mainly on retained earnings and loans from development financial institutions, such as DBZ, LIMA Bank and Co-operative Bank, for sourcing long-term finance. Hence, only firms in certain prioritized sectors and those with close ties (informal or formal) to these institutions were in a position to easily expand their activities. In the reform process, the development of capital markets was considered as key in enhancing the rate of capital formation and of importance in facilitating privatization. There was no organized market for long term instruments hence most stocks were traded on over the counter basis with no formal rules and regulations. Following the enactment of the Securities Act, the Government, with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), established the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) in February 1994. This broadened the sources of finance for companies through the issuance of equity and/or debt instruments. Business houses can now source cheaper funds from investors by listing their shares on the LuSE instead of borrowing from commercial banks, often at high rates of interest.

CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION

The LuSE was organized as a single market with an upper tier, or Official List, and lower tier, or quoted sector. The upper tier comprises larger companies that have more than 300 shareholders and have complied with both SEC registration requirements and LuSE listing criteria. The lower tier is simply companies that have been registered with the SEC but have not sought admittance to the LuSE Official List. Bond Market in Zambia The bond market is important for the capital market because it serves as a pricing benchmark and, in particular, promotes the development and growth of financial instruments and products. Currently, the bond market is rudimentary and narrow. The main challenge is to develop broad and deep primary and secondary bond markets. In the absence of a well-functioning bond market, savers face a diminished array of financial assets. Savers will hold more substitute assets such as bank deposits and possibly less likely, equity and probably more non-financial assets such as property that reduce the supply of savings that can be mobilized for productive investments. This is true for Zambia. More people hold most of their savings in the form of deposits and to a certain extent hold the funds in dollar accounts. Savers are forced to accept lower return in the absence of competitive financial instruments. In Zambia, most firms rely more on the short term bank financing. These types of funds cannot finance long term investment projects that will in the medium to long term increase employment and economic growth. Without serious competition from the bond market, the banking sector will be larger than it would otherwise be. Banks tend to have more deposits at lower cost because their customers have limited financial assets alternatives and, as such, banks have more corporate loans because the firms have few other sources of finance. Government Bonds The development of the government bond market in any economy is very important in that, it is the sure way the Government deficits can be covered in a less inflationary way. It is therefore imperative that, the Zambian Government is encouraged to finance its budget deficits through borrowing from the bond market. The only way it would successfully fund itself through the market is by developing the market for long-term financial instruments.

CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION

Prior to 1995, government bonds were sold at a fixed interest rate and on an ad hoc tap basis. In 1998, the BoZ in collaboration with LuSE took steps to enhance and develop the secondary market in long term instruments by listing government bonds on the LuSE for secondary market trading. It was expected that, the establishment of a formal central market in bonds would produce a number of benefits to the Zambian financial system and the economy such as the following: i.	 Enhanced liquidity in the secondary market; ii.	 Price discovery and improved price formation as reflected in yields of bonds; iii.	Broader and much wider participation by both large (institutional) and small (individual) investors due to use of modern book entry system which eliminates the use of physical certificates; iv.	Better and improved transparency in all market dealings v.	 Creation of financial markets depth; and vi.	Development and emergence of longer dated capital market instruments. Currently, Government bonds are of three maturity categories of 12, 18 and 24 months, offered to the public on a competitive basis through tender and also through the noncompetitive window for amounts less than K30 million. Corporate Bond Market The corporate bond market in Zambia remains relatively underdeveloped. There have been about four corporate bonds on the market of varying tenure ranging from 3–12 years. These include Farmers House for US $1million issued in 1999; Barclays Bank for K30 billion issued in 2003; Lunsemfwa Hydro Power US $7 million issued in 2003; and Arcades US $1.5 million issued in 2003. All these bonds are quoted or listed on the LuSE but are not traded actively. This situation reflects the nascence state of the corporate bond market.

CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION

8.3	 OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES OF CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION
Throughout the twentieth century, capital markets have played an increasingly important role in the development of market economies. Governments around the world are recognizing that efficient securities market regulation is critical to the development of any market based economy. There are basically 3 objectives of capital market regulation: •	 To project investors; •	 To assure that markets are fair, efficient and transparent; •	 To reduce systematic risk. In order for countries to regulate capital markets effectively, Corporate Governance is very vital. Corporate Governance tackles the agency problem which exists in companies where ownership and management is separate. The following are the principles of good corporate governance that help in securities markets’ regulation: •	 The right of shareholders which entails that the corporate governance framework of each country should protect shareholder’s rights. •	 The equal treatment of shareholders whether foreign, minority or majority. •	 The role of stakeholders in corporate governance which entails that corporate governance framework of each country should recognize the rights of stakeholders (employees, government, suppliers). •	 Disclosure and transparency. •	 The responsibility of the board to ensure effective management and monitoring of the business. A corporate governance code for listed and quoted companies on the Lusaka Stock Exchange exist effective 1 January 2005. The code is also endorsed by the Zambia Institute of Directors where Lusaka Stock Exchange is a member.

CAPITAL MARKET REGULATION

Key to a successful securities trading system is that all investors share equally in the risks and opportunities of investment. Although internationally agreed standards are not new, in the past few years, considerable effort has been made to address the development of internationally recognized standards to provide policymakers with benchmarks of good practice in key areas. The adopted standards (benchmarks of good practice) are designed to offer a roadmap to improve economic policymaking and strengthen the financial system. Standards and codes cover a number of economic and financial areas, including data dissemination; fiscal, monetary, and financial policy transparency; banking regulation and supervision; securities and insurance regulation; accounting, auditing, and bankruptcy; and corporate governance. Among international standards aimed at improving security markets around the world are the objectives and principles of securities regulation issued by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the global forum for securities regulators. In September 1998, IOSCO released 30 principles of securities regulation, which IOSCO members believe from the basis for an effective system of regulation of securities and derivatives markets. The document sets sound prudential principles and practices for the regulation and supervision of securities regulators and a yardstick against which progress toward effective regulation can be measured. The 30 principles are grouped into eight categories as follows: a)	 Principles relating to the regulator 1.	 The responsibilities of the regulator should be clear and objectively stated; 2.	 The regulator should be operationally independent and accountable in the exercise of its functions and powers; 3.	 The regulator should have adequate powers, proper resources, and the capacity to perform its functions and exercise its powers; 4.	 The regulator should adopt clear and consistent regulatory processes; 5.	 The staff of the regulator should observe the highest professional standards, including appropriate standards of confidentiality. b)	 Principles for self-regulation 6.	 The regulatory regime should make appropriate use of self-regulatory organizations (SROs) that exercise some direct oversight responsibility for their respective areas of competence, to the extent appropriate to the size and complexity of the markets; 7.	 SROs should be subject to the oversight of the regulator and should observe standards of fairness and confidentiality when exercising powers and delegated responsibilities.

c)	 Principles for the enforcement of securities regulation 8.	 The regulator should have comprehensive inspection, investigation, and surveillance powers; 9.	 The regulator should have comprehensive enforcement powers; 10.	The regulatory system should ensure an effective and credible use of inspection, investigation, surveillance, and enforcement powers and implementation of an effective compliance program. d)	 Principles for cooperation in regulation. 11.	 The regulator should have authority to share both public and foreign counterparts; 12.	Regulators should establish information sharing mechanisms that set out when and how they will share both public and confidential information with their domestic and foreign counterparts; 13.	The regulatory system should allow for assistance to be provided to foreign regulators who need to make inquiries in the discharge of their functions and exercise of their powers.

MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL CRIME PREVENTION

9	 MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL CRIME PREVENTION
9.1	INTRODUCTION
Financial crime and money laundering has the potential to collapse any economy because it creates an alternative economy within an economy that cannot be monitored or controlled by government. Such alternative economies cannot be taxed by government therefore reducing government tax revenues. Alternative economies can also be used to fund criminal activities like terrorism hence the need for strong regulatory framework and regulatory bodies. This chapter provides an understanding of the following: •	 •	 •	 •	 Definitions and nature of money laundering and financial crime Prohibition and prevention of money laundering legislation Various types of suspicious financial activities Measures to reduce financial crime

9.2	 OVERVIEW OF MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL CRIME
There are various definitions which are used to describe the phrase ‘Money Laundering’. Article 1 of the draft European Communities (EC) Directive of March 1990 defines it as: the conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from serious crime, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in committing such an offence or offences to evade the legal consequences of his action, and the concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to, or ownership of property, knowing that such property is derived from serious crime. Money laundering is also the process by which large amounts of illegally obtained money (from drug trafficking, terrorist activity or other serious crimes) is given the appearance of having originated from a legitimate source. If done successfully, it allows criminals to maintain control over their proceeds and ultimately provide a legitimate cover for the source of their income. Money laundering plays a fundamental role in facilitating the ambitions of the drug trafficker, the terrorist, the organized criminal, the insider dealer, the tax evader as well as the many others who need to avoid the kind of attention from the authorities that sudden wealth brings from illegal activities. By engaging in this type of activity it is hoped to place the proceeds beyond the reach of any asset forfeiture laws.
