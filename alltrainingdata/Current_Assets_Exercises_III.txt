Problem 1

Problem 1
Alpine Medical Corporation (AMC) accepts credit card payments from its patients. Following are the batched transactions for May 19. 1)	 Total charges on MoreMoney and Wind credit cards were $42,000. These cards are “bank cards” and AMC receives daily cash settlement directly to its bank account, net of service charges of 1.5%. 2)	 Total charges on EuropeanExpress cards were $6,000. This card is not a bank card, and settlement does not occur until approximately two weeks following the date of the transaction. EuroExpress is known to charge a 4% fee, and this amount is recorded on the day of sale. Prepare journal entries for the credit card transactions. Be sure to include a separate entry for the eventual collection of the EuroExpress charges.

Problem 2
ThermoGlare distrubutes customized parts for sports cars. The company has a broad customer base, and routinely sells on credit. Annually, the company reviews and updates its allowance for uncollectible accounts. Periodic write-offs against the allowance account are made throughout the year when individual accounts are deemed to be worthless. Following are relevant facts for the current year: Prior to recording any year-end adjustments, the total balance of all accounts receivable amounted to $1,150,000. The existing Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts had a balance of $9,000. No entry was made during the year to increase this account, but $20,000 of uncollectible accounts were written off against the allowance during the year. a)	 What was the beginning-of-year balance for the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts? b)	 Prepare a summary journal entry that reflects the $20,000 of write-offs already recorded by Pablo’s. c)	 Assuming that the year-end allowance should equal 3% of outstanding receivables, what end-of-year adjusting entry is needed? d)	 How will the accounts receivable and allowance appear on the balance sheet? e)	 How much expense will appear in the annual income statement as uncollectible accounts expense?

Problem 3

Problem 3
Duchetti Corporation utilizes an accounting software package that is capable of producing a detailed aging of outstanding accounts receivable. Following is the aging schedule as of December 31, 20X5.
AGE 0 to 30 days 31 to 60 days 61 to 120 days Over 120 days AMOUNT OUTSTANDING $ 3,600,000 2,100,000 600,000 75,000

Bruno Duchetti has owned and operated Duchetti Corporation for many years and has a very good sense of the probability of collection of outstanding receivables, based on an aging analysis. The following table reveals the likelihood of collection:
AGE 0 to 30 days 31 to 60 days 61 to 120 days Over 120 days PROBABILITY OF COLLECTION 97% 85% 70% 50%

a)	 Prepare an aging analysis and show how accounts receivable and the related allowance for uncollectibles should appear on the balance sheet at December 31. b)	 Prepare the necessary journal entry to update the allowance for uncollectibles, assuming the balance prior to preparing the aging was a $45,000 credit. c)	 Prepare the necessary journal entry to update the allowance for uncollectibles, assuming the balance prior to preparing the aging was a $15,000 debit. How could the allowance account have contained a debit balance?

The allowance account is a contra account to accounts receivable and would normally have a credit balance. A debit balance would be created if more accounts were actually written off against the account than was its balance. The situation would be rectified with an end-of-period adjustment, as shown. The debit balance might suggest that insufficient estimates of anticipated write-offs were previously established.

Problem 4

Problem 4
Allen Corporation follows generally accepted accounting principles in accounting for uncollectibles. Wang received notification from a bankruptcy court that its customer, Spandex Limited, had been adjudicated and released from all claims presently pending against it by Allen Corporation. Clint Allen, owner of Allen Corporation, was not at all pleased with this decision. Clint had anticipated recovering at least $75,000 from Spandex Limited, and that balance remained in the Accounts Receivable accounts of Allen Corporation. Because Allen Corporation has no further remedies for collection, Clint directed the accounting department to prepare a journal entry to write off the account of Spandex Limited. a)	 Prepare the journal entry to write off the Spandex Limited account. b)	 Suppose Spandex Limited recovered from its bankruptcy and eventually voluntarily paid the $75,000 “owed” to Allen. Prepare Allen’s journal entries to record the unexpected recovery.

Problem 5
Prepare journal entries for each of the following transactions: On July 1, 20X7, Ching received a 5%, 1-year, note receivable from Harris. This note was issued in payment for a $36,000 outstanding account receivable. On July 31, 20X7, Ching recorded an end-of-year adjusting entry to record accrued interest on the note receivable. On June 30, 20X8, Harris paid Ching the full amount due on the note receivable. How would the June 30 entry differ if Harris defaulted on the payment?

Problem 6
Kassie Jensen was recently hired as the chief financial officer for Haggen Corporation. At the time Kassie was hired, the company had just completed the accounting cycle for the year ending December 31, 20X7. Kassie began her new job by reviewing the following information about sales and receivables activity during the year:
Beginning accounts receivable Beginning allowance for uncollectibles Sales on account Collections on account Sales Discounts Accounts written-off Additions to allowance for uncollectible accounts $ 2,250,000 60,000 9,000,000 7,200,000 102,000 49,500 2% of net sales

a)	 Based on her review, Kassie prepared some handwritten notes in journal entry form summarizing the above sales, collections, discounts, write-offs, and additions to the allowance. She wanted to compare her entries to what had actually been recorded by the company. How should her summary entries appear?

b)	 After completing her review, Kassie concluded that beginning in 20X8, the company would switch to a balance sheet approach for providing for uncollectible accounts. She estimates that the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts should include an end-of-year balance equal to 3% of total gross receivables. Prepare summary journal entries for 20X8 to capture the following information, and to update the allowance account from its beginning of year balance (see part (a) to determine the beginning balance).

Problem 8
ToGo Lighting Corporation sells customized stage lighting equipment for use in the entrainment industry. ToGo has a broad dealer network. One dealer, Boonlert-U-Thai, obtained a large contract with a ship builder to install an elaborate stage lighting system produced by ToGo. The new cruise ship was being promoted as the Broadway on the Water, and promised to offer the world’s finest theatrical performances at sea. In 20X2, ToGo sold the lighting equipment to Boonlert-U-Thai for RMB 22,500,000. Terms were 20% cash payment, and the balance in 75 days. The extended payment terms were necessary because BoonlertU-Thai needed to collect from the ship builder before being able to pay ToGo. Unfortunately, Boonlert-U-Thai experienced difficulties. It seems the floor of the stage was equipped with a sophisticated leveling system that caused it to move in counter-motion to the ship’s rocking while at sea. This feature provided entertainers with a stable stage on which to perform. However, this attribute was not considered in the design of the lighting equipment. As a result, when the ship rocked, the beams from the lights moved all about on the stage. No one was happy, and the cruise ship delayed payment to Boonlert-U-Thai. Boonlert-U-Thai was not able to pay ToGo. All parties believed some resolution and payment would eventually occur, but the timing was uncertain. a)	 Prepare ToGo’s journal entry to record the initial sale and down payment. Be sure to also record the cost of goods sold (assume the lighting equipment cost ToGo RMB 16,500,000 and the company uses a perpetual inventory system). b)	 After 75 days, Boonlert-U-Thai paid an additional RMB 3,000,000 and executed a 180-day, 6%, promissory note for the unpaid balance. Prepare ToGo’s entry. c)	 ToGo’s accounting year ended 60 days following the execution of the promissory note. Prepare the end-of-year adjusting entry. d)	 180 days following the execution of the promissory note, all matters had been resolved and Boonlert-U-Thai paid the full amount due on the promissory note. Prepare ToGo’s journal entry.
