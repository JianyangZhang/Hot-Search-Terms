Preface

Preface
International businesses are increasingly the norm in countries around the globe. As companies look abroad for attractive markets and to acquire strategic resources and capabilities, they need a flexible, navigable route for ensuring that when they “go global” they also generate value. This e-book offers a simple, relevant approach to understanding global business. It answers questions such as: •	 Who are the key participants in international business? •	 What do they do? In what systems do they operate? •	 What perspectives on global strategy should they use? •	 How should they build competitiveness across borders? Building on the author’s journalistic and academic experience spanning three continents, this e-book sums up core issues in global business and offers insights into how firms can best implement global strategies. Organised around two parts, the book explains how firms can gain from globalisation. Part I (International Business) explains what international business is and outlines the foundations of international business (actions, actors, and systems) and the international business environment. Part II (Global Strategy) explains the distinction between a global and regional strategy, presents core global strategy frameworks and explains key perspectives and layers of global strategy. Our research with over 200 students from over 20 countries has shown that students don’t learn effectively from hard to understand irrelevant theory, and when they don’t feel engaged. Thus we have created a textbook that is not only free and light as a feather but also offers: •	 relevant examples •	 simple explanations •	 an engaging website Visit our website to learn more about the e-book’s features and engage in co-creating it on Facebook: www.featherlight.net

Preface

This book features an innovative “FLEXI” approach to global business: •	 F stands for Focus: showcasing a particular global trend or a featured global example •	 L stands for Layman’s terms: explaining key terms and concepts in plain English •	 E stands for E-tools: online tools with real-time data to assure timeliness and relevance •	 X stands for X-factor data: a key statistic or fact accurately documenting a global trend •	 I stands for Implications: implications for business with lessons learned and action steps Acknowledgments I would like to thank Ben Gomes-Casseres, Gloria Ge, Dan Tisch, Jonas Puck, Jonathan Doh, Joanna Scott-Kennel and Maureen Benson-Rea for useful comments on the initial book design and contents. I also appreciate greatly assistance and feedback from Andrew Badri, Paramita Turner and Paul Rataul. •	 Feedback on the content from 7 teachers from 4 continents •	 Co-designed and edited by distinguished former students •	 Co-created with over 200 students from over 20 countries

FLEXI route to understanding global business
While the content of this e-book will give you a lot of relevant knowledge, perhaps the most important “takeaway” from using it is to remember the underlying framework. The FLEXI framework will enable you to create value in your specific context by doing the exercises, reading the mini-cases and other content, and leveraging your knowledge to advance the next phase of your career. Examples of each of the five key steps of the “FLEXI” route are scattered throughout the book. They are also included on the book website (www.featherlight.net) under menu tabs titled “FOCUS”, “LAYMAN’S TERMS”, “E-TOOLS, “X-FACTOR DATA”, and “IMPLICATIONS”. These tabs will make it possible for you to add comments and see the comments of others. Additional examples and videos are uploaded on the e-book’s Facebook group.

Preface

Global business mostly requires air travel. The FLEXI route can be seen as an allegory of boarding an airplane and finding the flight route to your destination. The route is not straightforward but there are certain navigational tools that can help you to land safely. The FLEXI framework and its elements are meant to become such tools on your route to understanding global business.

1	Foundations of international business
The next ten chapters examine key concepts and issues in international business. Part I (International Business) will be followed by ten chapters on global strategy (Part II): how firms can position themselves globally and regionally, and harness benefits from globalisation. The “International Business” chapters are organised along three key pillars: 1.	 International business actions: trading, investing and globalising 2.	 International business actors: firms, governments and institutions 3.	 International business systems: trade, currency and finance The figure below sums up key issues and concepts covered in each of the pillars:

Your goals for each of the ten “International Business” chapters are to learn: Ch. 1: The definition, domains and distinguishing features of international business. Ch. 2: The nature, history and key aspects of globalisation of markets, production and technology. Ch. 3: The key concepts in international trade and theories explaining trade and competition. Ch. 4: The key concepts, patterns and theories of foreign direct investment. Ch. 5: The key firm-level participants in international business and theories of internationalisation. Ch. 6: The role of governments in international business, including trade and investment policy. Ch. 7: The role of intergovernmental institutions (e.g. the World Bank) in international business. Ch. 8: The levels of economic integration and other features of the modern world trade system. Ch. 9: The key concepts in foreign exchange and currency systems, risk analysis and management. Ch. 10: The key players and business risks in the global monetary and financial systems. Traditionally, an international business (IB) is defined as a business (or firm) that engages in international (cross-border) economic activities (Peng 2013). International business can also refer to the action of doing business abroad. Cavusgil et al. (2015) define IB as: the performance of trade and investment activities by firms across national borders. The “business” (or the “firm”) from the international business definition has commonly been associated with the multinational enterprise (MNE), defined as any business that has productive activities in two or more countries (Hill 2016). Global business is a more recent concept, defined as business around the globe (Peng 2014). Global business activities include both 1) international activities covered by traditional international business books and 2) domestic (non-IB) business activities, such as responses of local firms to MNE entrants. It is important not to confuse international business with international management and international economics, although these are related disciplines and often partly covered in IB textbooks. International management: The process of applying management concepts and techniques in a multinational environment and adapting management practices to different economic, political and cultural contexts (Luthans & Doh 2012). International economics: Consists of issues raised by the special problems of economic interaction between sovereign states. The main themes are: the gains from trade, the pattern of trade, protectionism, the balance of payments, exchange rate determination, international policy coordination, and the international capital market (Krugman & Obstfeld 2005).

LAYMAN’S TERMS: don’t confuse international business (IB), international economics (IE) and international management (IM). A simple way to understand the differences between them is that while IM tends to focus on people and IE on countries as units of analysis, IB focuses on firms in relation to their international environment. While IB mostly looks at implications for firms, IM mostly looks for implications for managers and IE, implications for policy-makers.

The Journal of International Business Studies is the top ranked journal in the field of IB. It accepts submissions based on what it sees as the six domains of international business: 1)	 activities, strategies, structures and decision-making processes of multinational enterprises; 2)	 interactions between multinational enterprises and other actors, organisations, institutions etc.; 3)	 cross-border activities of firms (e.g., trade, finance, investment, technology transfers); 4)	 how the international environment affects the processes of firms; 5)	 international dimensions of organisational forms; and 6)	 cross-country comparative studies of businesses in different countries and environments.

International business and globalisation

2	International business and globalisation
Globalisation is the close integration of countries and peoples around the world (Peng 2013). Traditionally, international business has been stressing the economic dimension of globalisation. Hill (2015, 2016) defines it as the shift toward a more integrated and interdependent world economy. Economic globalisation: the tendency toward an international integration of goods, technology, information, labour, and capital, or the process of making this integration happen (Hill 2015). This aspect of globalisation is related to and sometimes called globalisation of markets: the gradual integration and growing interdependence of national economies (Cavusgil 2015). It is slightly distinct from the term “market globalisation” or “the merging of historically distinct and separate national markets into one huge global marketplace” (Hill 2015, 2016). This “marketing” understanding of globalisation originates in Theodore Lewitt’s pioneering article in the Harvard Business Review, one of the most famous sources for managerially relevant but academically grounded articles on (international) business issues.1 From the sourcing side, economic globalisation also entails globalisation of production: sourcing of goods and services from locations around the globe to take advantage of national differences in the cost and quality of various factors of production (such as labour, energy, land and capital) (Hill 2016). More broadly, globalisation can be defined as “the socio-economic reform process of eliminating trade, investment, cultural, information technology, and political barriers across countries, which in turn can lead to increased economic growth and geo-political integration and interdependence among nations of the world” (Gaspar et al. 2014). Technological globalisation is a result of the rise of information technology and decreasing costs of global communication. Multinational enterprises such as Google, eBay and Facebook have played an important role in this process although they have a number of strong local/international competitors.
FOCUS: Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba defeated eBay on its home turf in China, but interestingly later internationalised by listing on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014, becoming the largest initial public offering (IPO) in world history. This shows that globalisation is not a trend solely driven by US or Western MNEs. Emerging giants from emerging markets will be discussed further in Part II of the e-book. Jack Ma (pictured below), the chairman of Alibaba, was China’s richest man in 2014.

Phases of globalisation (a brief history of the world economy) 1st phase (1830–1880): Trade and the British Empire (ocean transport, railroads, trading companies) 2nd phase (1900–1945): The International Corporation (electricity and steel, European and US MNEs) 3rd phase (1948–1970s): End of World War II (GATT/WTO, Marshall Plan, Rise of Japan & Brands) 4th phase (1980–present): End of Cold War (Privatisation, ICTs, Rise of China & Emerging Markets) Source: adapted from Cavusgil et al. (2015) According to Bremmer (2014), we have entered another phase of globalisation in the aftermath of the global recession of 2008–2009. He calls this phase guarded globalisation, suggesting that governments of developing nations have become wary of opening more industries to multinational enterprises and they are zealously protecting local interests. Example: India’s Patent Office revoked Pfizer’s patent for the cancer drug Sutent and granted a domestic manufacturer, Cipla, the right to produce a cheaper generic version.

FOCUS: Can Cloud Atlas explain the next phase of globalisation? Cloud Atlas, a German/American movie with a budget of over US $100 million, received a significant portion of its financing from China. One reason for this was to gain access to the increasingly important Chinese market, where a limited number of foreign movies are allowed every year. While the movie made a loss globally (earning around US $85 million), it was a hit in China with over US $15 million of revenues. The movie revolves around interwoven stories from six eras. The story of its actual production could provide a clue to the next phase of globalisation. It is likely to be driven by complex interactions between “Western” and Chinese/ emerging market (business) actors. It will require careful consideration of both the costs and benefits of globalisation, and attention to key growth markets.

International business and trade

3	 International business and trade
The most conventional forms of international business transactions are international trade and investment. International trade refers to an exchange of products and services across national borders through exporting or importing (Cavusgil et al. 2015). Export: to sell abroad (Peng 2013) or the sale of products or services to customers located abroad, from a base in the home country or a third country (Cavusgil et al. 2015). Import (or global sourcing): to buy from abroad (Peng 2013) or the procurement of products or services from suppliers located abroad for consumption in the home country or a third country (Cavusgil et al. 2015). Merchandise trades: tangible products that are bought and sold while service trades are intangible services (such as air travel or financial services) that are bought and sold (Peng 2013).

X-FACTOR DATA

Fig 3.1 International trade in services (adapted from Cavusgil et al. 2015)

Why do nations, industries and firms pursue international markets as exporters and importers? Traditional explanations of international trade have referred to comparative advantage, the superior features of a country – typically derived from either natural endowments or deliberate national policies – that provide it with unique benefits in global competition (Cavusgil et al. 2015). Raymond Vernon from Harvard University developed the international product life cycle theory, a dynamic theory to account for changes in the patterns of trade over time. It suggests a pattern of change over time between most developed nations, other developed nations and developing nations as production shifts and the product’s life cycle moves from new to maturing to standardised (Peng 2013). See the figure below for a graphical representation of his theory. Scholars sought to explain not only why international trade was good for individual nations, but how nations could position themselves for international business success. Harvard professor Michael Porter made a seminal contribution in this respect in The Competitive Advantage of Nations (1990). Competitive advantage is usually defined as distinctive assets or competencies of a firm – typically derived from cost, size or innovation strengths – that are difficult for competitors to replicate or imitate. According to Michael Porter, nations can have a competitive advantage as well, which depends on the collective competitive advantages of the nation’s firms (Cavusgil et al. 2015).

Fig 3.2 International product life cycle theory (adapted from Vernon 1966; and www.provenmodels.com)

As part of his explanation in the Competitive Advantage of Nations (1990), Michael Porter developed the Diamond Model (see the figure below). This theory focuses on why certain industries within a nation are competitive internationally. For example, while Japanese automobile industries are globally successful, Japanese service industries are not (Peng 2013). Porter argues that the competitive advantage of certain industries in different nations depends on four aspects (Hill 2016): 1)	 Home factor conditions: home-grown resources and natural endowments 2)	 Home demand conditions: the nature of home demand for the industry’s products 3)	 Home firm strategy, structure and rivalry: the conditions governing firm creation etc. 4)	 Related and supporting industries: the presence of internationally competitive suppliers etc. E-tool: Key websites for international trade statistics: The World Trade Organisation: www.wto.org The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development: www.oecd.org

Fig 3.3 Diamond of national advantage (adapted from Porter 1990)

LAYMAN’S TERMS: comparative advantage and competitive advantage. The concept of comparative advantage is more rooted in economics and refers to a superior feature of a nation or industry. The concept of a competitive advantage is more rooted in strategic management and refers to distinctive assets or competencies of a firm. However, sometimes authors argue that nations or industries can have a competitive advantages as well (Porter 1990). The key distinction is that while comparative advantage seeks to explain patterns and gains from trade, the competitive advantage explains which firms, industries or nations will be winners in a global competition and how they can position themselves for it.

Exercise: Choose a country that is a leading exporter of a particular product or service. Outline which of these following concepts best explain why it is successful in exporting that product or service: comparative advantage, competitive advantage, international product life cycle theory, diamond model. Exercise: Why has China surpassed Germany and US as the world’s leading exporter? Use theories of international trade to provide an explanation. If they are insufficient, use your own logic and reasoning. Exercise: Choose an industry and a country. Apply Porter’s Diamond model to analyse the competitive advantages of this industry in the face of global competition. Be specific about each of the factors affecting it.

International business and investment

4	International business and investment
International investment happens primarily in two ways: foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment. FDI is defined as direct investment in business operations in a foreign country (Hill 2016) or investing in, controlling, and managing value-added activities in other countries (Peng 2013). Statistically, FDI is usually defined as an equity (ownership) stake of 10% or more in a foreign-based enterprise (according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). It is distinct from foreign portfolio investment, which refers to holding securities, such as stocks and bonds, of companies in countries outside one’s own but does not entail the active management of these foreign assets (Peng 2013). This is essentially “foreign indirect investment”. Flow of FDI: the amount of FDI undertaken over a given time period, usually a year (Peng 2013). Stock of FDI: the total accumulated value of foreign-owned assets at a given time (Peng 2013) or the total value of assets that MNEs own abroad via their investment activities (Cavusgil et al. 2015).

Outflows of FDI: outward flow of FDI from a country. Example: If BMW, based in Germany, builds a plant in South Africa, this would represent an outflow of FDI from Germany into South Africa. Inflows of FDI: flow of FDI into a country. Example: If US Wal-Mart opens stores in Germany, there would be an inflow of FDI into Germany. (Note: both examples are from a German perspective.) FDI takes on two main forms. The first is a greenfield investment, which involves the establishment of a new operation in a foreign country. The second involves acquiring or merging with an existing firm in a foreign country (often referred to as mergers and acquisitions or M&A) (Hill 2016). X-FACTOR DATA

Fig 4.2 Foreign direct investment trends (adapted from UNCTAD)

Theories of foreign direct investment: FDI is such an important entry strategy that academics provide three alternative theories of how firms can use it to gain and sustain competitive advantage: 1)	 Monopolistic advantage theory: FDI is made by firms in oligopolistic (highly concentrated) industries possessing technical and other advantages over local firms (Ball et al. 2013). 2)	 Internalisation theory: to obtain a higher return on its investment, a firm will opt to transfer its superior knowledge to a foreign subsidiary, rather than sell it on the open market (Ball et al. 2013). The key aspect of the theory is that the firm acquires and retains one or more valuechain activities within the firm rather than licensing them, ensuring greater control over foreign operations (Cavusgil et al., 2015). 3)	 Dunning’s eclectic “OLI” paradigm: extends the previous two models by adding “locationspecific” advantages to the explanation of both the rationale for and the direction of FDI. He retains the “firm-specific” advantages element but refers to them as “Ownership” advantages, and he includes “Internalisation” advantages in his theory. It is thus also called the theory of OLI advantages.2

οο Ownership advantages: possessing and leveraging certain valuable, rare, hard-to-imitate, and organisationally embedded (VRIO) firm-specific assets overseas in the context of FDI. οο Location advantages: advantages enjoyed by a firm that derive from the places in which it operates (Peng 2013). οο Internalisation advantages: advantages enjoyed by a firm that keeps activities internal (inhouse), thus replacing cross-border activities with other firms (such as exporting and importing) within one firm (the MNE) located in two or more countries (Peng 2013).

5	 Firms and international business
Although scholars have traditionally focused on large multinational enterprises (MNEs) as key actors in international business, there are a number of other participants. Cavusgil et al. (2015, p. 63) highlight three types of organisational participants that make international business happen: 1)	 Focal firm: The initiator of an IB transaction that conceives, designs and produces the products/ services intended for consumption by customers worldwide. Focal firms include MNEs and small and medium-sized enterprises. 2)	 Distribution channel intermediary: A specialist firm that provides various logistics and marketing services for focal firms as part of their international supply chains. 3)	 Facilitator: A firm or an individual with special expertise in providing legal advice, banking, customs clearance or related support services that assists focal firms in the performance of IB transactions. Exercise: Identify each of these three types of firms online to learn about their activities. These three types of participants are part of what is often called the international or global value chain (UNCTAD 2013). A value chain is defined as a series of activities used in the production of goods and services that make a product or service more valuable (Peng 2013, p. 52).

Fig 5.1 Internationalisation of a firm’s value chain: an example of Dell (adapted from Cavusgil et al. 2015)

Exercise: Think of a firm and check all stages of its value chain. Recreate this figure for that firm. Peng (2013) stresses that most textbooks and theories of international business neglect the role of the domestic firms in international business. This has also been promoted by Hennart (2009) who criticised MNE-centric theories and explained how domestic firms often actively compete and/or collaborate with foreign entrants. Internationalisation process theory, often known as the Uppsala Model, due to its founders’ affiliation with Uppsala University (Sweden), is one of the core firm-level explanations of IB activities.3 It has traditionally been applied to MNEs, arising from analysis of Swedish multinationals. According to this model, internationalisation is a gradual process that takes place in incremental stages over a long period of time (Cavusgil et al. 2015, p. 166). Typically, internationalising firms begin with exporting and progress to FDI only later after gaining more experience (see Figure 5.2). The theory also suggests that firms first expand in geographically and culturally less distant countries. Example: Swedish car-maker Volvo first expanded abroad via exports only, then built plants overseas.

LAYMAN’S TERMS: internationalisation vs. internalisation. These two terms are often confused as they sound similar but the key distinction is that internationalisation refers to the process of how firms become international, while internalisation (explained in chapter 4) refers to the decision to retain or acquire control of value chain activities, such as production within the firm (internally).

Theory of International New Ventures (INVs) challenges the Uppsala model and claims that in today’s globalised and technologically connected world, many firms can internationalise rapidly. An INV is defined as a business organisation that, from inception, seeks to derive significant competitive advantage from the use of resources and sale of outputs in multiple countries.4 Born globals are firms that internationalise in their operations from the beginning. They are similar to INVs but are often defined more stringently in terms of number of countries of operation. They learn fast and aggressively and build extensive global networks. Example: Swiss/US Logitech had its R&D in Ireland, production in Taiwan, and customers in Japan and a number of other countries within a few years of the company’s founding. Five key concepts in international business Liability of foreignness: the inherent disadvantage that foreign firms experience in host countries because of their non-native status (Peng 2014, p. 16). This is related to what Hymer (1976) called “additional costs of doing business abroad”. The concept has been developed by Zaheer (1995) in her analysis of the performance of foreign exchange traders in New York City and Tokyo. Sethi & Judge (2009) reappraised liabilities of foreignness within an integrated perspective of the costs and benefits of doing business abroad. Nachum (2010) has contributed to the research by analysing when foreignness is an asset and when it is a liability. Firm-specific advantages (FSAs): (also called firm-specific assets/resources/capabilities) are strengths relative to rival companies (Verbeke 2013, p. 7) that are not shared by competitors in the same environments (Peng 2014, p. 16). Multinationals were traditionally thought to need these advantages to overcome the liability of foreignness, as without them they would lose out to local competitors. Hymer (1976) argued that an MNE should possess some kind of proprietary (firm-specific) or monopolistic advantage not available to local firms. These advantages can be economies of scale, superior technology, or marketing and management knowledge. These firm-specific advantages are similar to what Dunning called “ownership advantages” under his OLI framework, and are part of a “resource-based view” of the firm. Country-specific advantages (CSAs): strengths or benefits specific to a country that result from its competitive environment, labour force, geographic location, government policies, industrial clusters etc. (Rugman and Collinson 2012, p. 49). This term is related to and often used interchangeably with “location-specific advantages” from Dunning’s OLI framework. Cavusgil et al. (2015, p. 171) refer to CSAs as a unique set of comparative advantages from which companies can derive specific benefits. Managers of most MNEs use strategies that build on interactions of CSAs and FSAs. CSAs form the basis of a global platform from which the MNE derives a “home-base” advantage in global competition (Porter 1990). The MNE builds on them to make decisions about efficient global configuration and coordination between segments of its value chain (operations, marketing, R&D, logistics).

Global integration: the coordination of a firm’s value chain activities across countries to achieve worldwide efficiency, synergy and cross-fertilisation, in order to take maximum advantage of similarities between countries (Cavusgil 2015, p. 340). This framework considers both efficiency and learning as two elements of global integration. Firms that emphasise global integration make and sell products and services that are relatively standardised (uniform or with minimal adaptation) to capitalise on converging customer needs and tastes worldwide. They seek to minimise operating costs by centralising value chain activities and emphasising economies of scale (Bartlett & Ghoshal, 1989). Local responsiveness: the need to be responsive to different customer preferences around the world (Peng 2013, p. 170) or to meet the specific needs of buyers in individual countries (Cavusgil et al. 2015). Many companies seek to respond to specific conditions in local markets, managing diverse opportunities and risks on a country-by-country basis. Being locally responsive makes local customers and governments happy but unfortunately increases costs. When firms operate internationally, they need to strike the right balance between the objectives of global integration and local responsiveness. The integrationresponsiveness framework (Prahalad 1975) illustrates how to simultaneously deal with these two sets of pressures and objectives (see more on this in Part II, especially Chapter 18).

Exercise: Check your country’s standing in the recent report. What are its country specific advantages?
FOCUS: Global Car Industry. Toyota tends to focus on global integration approach, e.g. its Corolla model is not adapted very much across different international markets. General Motors, on the other hand, tends to use local adaptation a lot, i.e. it has separate country brands such as Opel in Europe and Holden in Australasia. Most companies retain elements of both strategies though. For example, luxury models of Volkswagen for the Chinese market have more leg room in the back as wealthier executives tend to have drivers. However, its SUV vehicles such as Audi Q7 are assembled in one factory for global markets. In fact, cars are often customised to individual needs.

6	Governments and international business
International businesses do not act without facing intervention from governments that regulate the international flow of trade and investment. Government intervention can take the forms of trade and investment barriers, as well as subsidies to local firms (Cavusgil et al. 2015, p. 221). Trade barriers include tariffs (also known as duties), which are taxes imposed on imported products. X-FACTOR DATA

Non-tariff barriers are government policies, regulations or procedures that impede trade through means other than explicit tariffs. Quotas (quantitative restrictions placed on imports of a specific product over a specific period of time) are a common form of this barrier. Other examples are customs procedures at checkpoints at the ports of entry in each country and import licenses (government authorisation granted to a firm for the import of a product). Investment restrictions: some countries such as India and China still impose ownership restrictions that restrict the ability of foreign firms to invest in some industry sectors or acquire local firms. For example, such restrictions have forced Walmart to enter India in a joint venture with local Bharti. Currency controls are restrictions on the outflow of hard currency from a country and can restrict the ability of MNEs to repatriate their profits back to their home countries. For example, in the Philippines, portfolio investors are required to hold their profits domestically for 90 days. Local content requirements require that some specific fraction of a good be produced domestically. These became increasingly popular after the Great Recession.5 Video: Check the Peterson Institute for International Economics website including this video: http:// www.iie.com/events/event_detail.cfm?EventID=297 Example: In the wind energy sector, the local content requirement has grown to over 50% after 2008 in China, Canada, Brazil and Spain. This sector also receives large subsidies in a number of countries. Subsidies are government payments to producers that can take many forms including cash grants, low-interest loans, tax breaks and government equity participation in domestic firms. Agriculture tends to be one of the largest beneficiaries of subsidies in most countries. For example, the European Union has been paying out about 44 billion euros annually to domestic producers. Other sectors benefit from grants as well. For example, Chinese auto exporters receive over $1 billion annually according to US sources (Cavusgil et al. 2015). These are examples of protectionism, national economic policies designed to restrict free trade and protect domestic industries from foreign competition (Cavusgil et al. 2015, p. 216). Privatisation is the sale of state-owned enterprises to private investors (Hill & Hult 2016). Domestic firms are not the only recipients of government subsidies. Many MNEs receive investment incentives to entice them to a country (notably including tax holidays).

Implications: How can firms respond to government intervention? Cavusgil (2015) suggest they: •	 Research to gather knowledge and intelligence •	 Choose the most appropriate entry strategies •	 Take advantage of foreign trade zones (exempt from customs duties) •	 Seek favourable customs classifications for exported products •	 Take advantage of investment incentives and other government support •	 Lobby for freer trade and investment Example: Hong Kong’s government paid $1.7 billion to Disney to build a Disneyland park there. Exercise: Choose a firm that is facing some government intervention in IB. Which of these 6 responses would you recommend and why? Country analysis Companies expanding abroad often consider country attractiveness based on these three factors: •	 Benefits (size of economy, likely economic growth) •	 Costs (corruption, lack of infrastructure, legal costs) •	 Risks (political, economic, legal and other risks)

Benefits and costs of operating abroad can be demonstrated by examining emerging markets. These are fast growing developing economies such as China, India and Nigeria. According to the latest United Nations estimate, in 2014 foreign direct investment in emerging markets accounted for 56% of all global FDI flows. This was driven by the increasing size and fast growth rate of these economies. E-tool: check World Bank data on GDP growth rates of countries around the world on this website: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG However, a study of 150 North American and European-based companies with annual revenues over US$ 1 billion found that, over the last five years, the average responding company faced costs of more than US$ 1 billion from transacting in emerging economies.6 The key causes of these costs were regulatory violations, loss of business and fines resulting from bribery, fraud and reputational damage. Risk assessment is a crucial part of country analysis. There are number of companies that provide information on country risk. The Economist Intelligence Unit, a subsidiary of The Economist Group, for example assesses risk across 180 countries around the world with indicators such as: •	 Security •	 Political stability •	 Government effectiveness •	 Legal and regulatory •	 Macroeconomic •	 Foreign trade & payments •	 Financial •	 Tax policy •	 Labour market •	 Infrastructure For example, in its August 2015 report on global risk scenarios, the Economist Intelligence Unit highlighted these five major risks for the world economy: 1)	 “Grexit” (exit of Greece from the euro zone) is followed up by a euro zone break-up 2)	 A commodity price/investment slump in China lead to the emerging-market slowdown 3)	 Russia’s intervention in Ukraine escalates, leading to cold war-era tensions 4)	 Global monetary policy divergence leads to extreme currency volatility 5)	 The rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilises the global economy

Exercise: Check the Economist Intelligence Unit website at www.eiu.com or find their reports in your local library. Choose a particular country and consider the political, economic, legal and business risks within that country. While economic, market and political risks are important and worry a large number of businesses, there is a wider array of risks that companies need to be aware of. The table below summarises the risk outlook as of 2015. Risks also vary across industries. The energy sector, for instance, worries most about political risk while for healthcare it is talent and skill shortages that matter most.

7	Institutions and international business
Since the Second World War, a number of important global institutions and intergovernmental organisations have been created to promote the establishment of multinational treaties to govern the global business system. The key organisations that manage, regulate and police the system are as follows: The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is a multilateral governing body empowered to regulate international trade and investment. It is primarily responsible for policing the world trading system and ensuring that nation-states adhere to the rules laid down in WTO treaties. www.wto.org The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created to maintain order in the international monetary system. The IMF is often seen as the lender of last resort to states whose economies are in turmoil and whose currencies are losing value against those of other nations. www.imf.org The World Bank was set up to promote economic development. It focuses on making low-interest loans to cash-strapped governments in poor nations that wish to undertake significant infrastructure investments (such as building dams or roads). www.worldbank.org

The world trade system

8	 The world trade system
Free trade agreement (FTA) is a formal agreement between two (bilateral) or more (multilateral) countries to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas and barriers to trade in products and services. Regional economic integration is a growing economic interdependence that results when two or more countries within a geographical region form an alliance aimed at reducing barriers to trade and investment (Cavusgil et al., p. 246) and reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers (Hill et al., p. 254). E-tool: globalEDGE: www.globaledge.msu.edu/global-resources/regional-trade-agreements On this website, you can review over 300 current trade agreements with recent news. Exercise: Choose one of the agreements from the globalEDGE website and access the specific resources on it. Describe the members of the agreement and give other relevant details on the agreement that might be of interest to exporters/international businesses from your country. Several levels of economic integration are possible, from the least to most integrated: Free trade area: a group of countries committed to removing all barriers to the free flow of goods and services between each other, but pursuing independent external trade policies. Examples: North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), ASEAN, EFTA, ANZCER. Customs union: a group of countries committed to removing all barriers to the free flow of goods and services between each other and the pursuit of a common external trade policy. Examples: MERCOSUR, Andean Community, South African Customs Union. Exercise: Use the website above to find out what ASEAN, EFTA, ANZCER and MERCOSUR are. Common market: a group of countries committed to removing all barriers to the free flow of goods and services and factors of production (e.g. labour, capital) between each other and the pursuit of a common external trade policy. Example: European Union pre-1992. Economic union: the same as the common market but countries are also committed to the adoption of a common currency (monetary policy) and the harmonisation of tax rates (fiscal policy). Example: European Union post-1992.

FOCUS: The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a regional trade, regulatory and investment treaty for nations in the Asia-Pacific region. As of 2015, twelve countries have participated in negotiations on the TPP: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam. With the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations through the WTO at an impasse, the TPP negotiations have taken centre stage as one of the most significant trade initiatives of the 21st century (Schott, Kotschwar & Muir 2013). However, a number of barriers – including agriculture, intellectual property, services, investment, and environment – have delayed its conclusion. Some activists accused the parties of secretive behaviour. An agreement on the treaty was reached in October 2015 with a compromise reached on sensitive sectors such as pharmaceuticals, automotive, dairy and rice.

The foreign exchange system

9	 The foreign exchange system
Foreign exchange rate is the rate at which one currency is converted into another. Currencies can experience appreciation, the increase in the value of the currency, or depreciation, a loss in the value of the currency in terms of another currency. Foreign exchange is all forms of money that are traded internationally, including foreign currencies, bank deposits, cheques and electronic transfers. The foreign exchange market is a market for converting the currency of one country into that of another country. Currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will hurt the profitability of a business or deal. Example: In January 2004, Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, reported a 95% drop in 2003 fourthquarter profits to €50 million due to a sharp appreciation of the Euro against USD.

The foreign exchange system

Why did the Euro appreciate sharply in 2003? How are exchange rates determined in general? These factors affect the supply and demand for a currency and its exchange rate (Cavusgil et al. 2015, p. 311): •	 Economic growth (productivity and balance of payments) •	 Interest rates (inflation, money supply, price differences) •	 Market psychology (investor psychology, herding behaviour) •	 Political action (exchange rate policies, central bank action) In general, a currency value rises with a higher demand and/or lower supply for it. Economic growth has a strong influence on the currencies. For example, rapid economic growth of several East Asian nations has stimulated a steadily increasing demand for their currencies. High interest rates also stimulate demand for a country’s currency, as foreigners seek profits through higher interest-bearing investment opportunities. Example: Australia’s relatively high interest rates lead to stronger foreign investment and currency. E-tool: Check http://www.dailyfx.com/ for foreign exchange rates and related news and analysis. Exercise: The Euro has been quite volatile in the last few years. Check its rate against a currency of your choice and try to explain which of the four factors have affected the Euro’s exchange rate recently. Market psychology is another important factor, as investors tend to mimic each other’s actions. Herding behaviour often occurs, as investors can sell a country’s currency after they fear that others will do so as well. Example: Asian Financial Crisis of 1997–1998. Political actions matter for currencies too. Central Bank (monetary authority) actions are crucial as these affect money supply and interest rates. Governments can also intervene, for instance, by devaluation to reduce the official value of its currency relative to others. Example: China is often accused of keeping the value of its currency “artificially” low. Exercise: Why would Chinese politicians want to keep the value of their currency “artificially” low? Who in China benefits from this and who is hurt? It is important to remember that it is very difficult to forecast exchange rates as all these factors coincide and are difficult to predict (Meese and Rogoff 1983).
FOCUS: Central bankers’ statements are closely watched as they foreshadow foreign exchange changes. Janet Yellen, Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, and Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, are two of the most watched people in international finance and business.

Types of currency risk: managerial implications of currency fluctuations (Hill 2016, p. 303): •	 Transaction exposure (extent to which income from transactions is affected) •	 Translation exposure (extent to which reported consolidated profits are affected) •	 Economic exposure (extent to which a firm’s future earnings power is affected) Currency hedging is a transaction that protects traders and investors from exposure to the fluctuations of the exchange rate. Example: Volkswagen increased the proportion of its hedged foreign currency exposure from 30% in 2003 to 70% in 2004 following the 2003 loss. Strategic hedging is one response to the foreign exchange risk. It is the diversification of activities in a number of countries in different currency zones to offset any currency losses in one region through gains in other regions. Review questions 1.

The global financial system

10	 The global financial system
International monetary system is the institutional framework, rules and procedures by which national currencies are exchanged for one another. It has evolved from the Gold Standard (value of currencies pegged to gold) and the Bretton Woods System (exchange rates pegged to the US dollar) to the current system that comprises two main types of foreign exchange management (and their mix): Floating exchange rate: a system under which the exchange rate is continuously adjusted depending on the laws of supply and demand. Fixed exchange rate: a system under which the exchange rate is fixed. Managed (dirty) float: a currency is allowed to float freely, but the government also intervenes by buying and selling the currency (if it believes that the currency is far from its fair value). Global financial system is the collective of financial institutions that facilitate and regulate investment and capital flows worldwide, e.g. central banks, commercial banks and stock exchanges. Key players in the monetary and financial systems are (according to Cavusgil et al. 2015): •	 The firm (MNEs, SMEs, insurance firms, stockbrokers, Western Union etc.) •	 National stock (equity) exchanges and bond (debt) markets •	 Banks (commercial, investment, merchant, private, offshore banks etc.) •	 Central banks (The Federal Reserve Bank of the US, The European Central Bank etc.) •	 International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) The globalisation of financial flows has yielded many benefits. It has improved access to finance for companies around the world. For instance, leading companies from emerging markets can list in stock exchanges in developed countries. Example: TCS Group, Russia’s credit card firm, listed in London. However, there are also risks connected to the globalisation of finance. Contagion is a tendency of a financial or monetary crisis in one country to spread rapidly to others due to global financial links.

FOCUS: Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008–2009: Of financial alchemists and ninjas. The GFC was a major crisis that emerged in the global financial and monetary systems. Initially it arose in the US, where investors lost confidence in the value of “securitised” home mortgages, complex financial instruments concocted by “financial alchemists” from Wall Street. While these instruments, with names such as “collateralised debt obligations”, were difficult to understand, they were often simply risky: based on home loans to high-risk clients, some of whom were “NINJAs” (no income, no job or assets). They were not able to repay the loans when the housing market collapsed. While the crisis started in the US, it has spread to Europe and beyond, resulting in a global recession and the GFC.

Implications: firms can respond to financial risks and opportunities through prudent financial management (Dowling et al. 2009, p. 331) such as: •	 Investment decisions – decisions about what activities to finance οο Example: Capital budgeting that quantifies the benefits, costs and risks of an investment •	 Financing decisions – decisions about how to finance those activities οο Choice between equity loan (selling shares to investors) and debt loan (bonds) •	 Money management decisions – decisions about how to manage the firm’s finances οο Example: Minimising cash balances, reducing transaction costs, tax optimisation

Ch. 15: The global competitive analysis including key models and strategies for various industries. Ch. 16: The importance of intangible resources, capability leverage and strategy building. Ch. 17: The perspectives and implications of institutions and ethics for conducting global strategy. Ch. 18: The organisational structures and implications of various strategies for global markets. Ch. 19: The importance of worldwide learning, innovation and knowledge management for MNEs. Ch. 20: The key forms of international business combinations and role of cooperative strategies. What is global strategy? Before we delve into a more in-depth discussion of global strategy, it will be helpful to clarify what strategy is. Porter (1996) suggests that competitive strategy is about “being different”. Strategy means deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver a unique mix of value. According to Peng (2014, p. 15), there are four fundamental questions of strategy: 1.	 Why do firms differ? 2.	 How do firms behave? 3.	 What determines the scope of the firm? 4.	 What determines the success and failure of firms?

Foundations of global strategy

Global strategy is attempting to answer these questions for MNEs and other firms around the globe. Peng (2014, p. 19) defines global strategy as strategy of firms around the globe. He notes that this definition is distinct from the traditional and narrowly defined notion of “global strategy” as a particular theory on how to compete (centred on offering standardised products and services on a worldwide basis). This narrow definition of “global strategy” is explained in more detail in ch. 13. Peng’s global strategy definition builds on the concept of “global business” introduced earlier in ch. 1. Tallman (2009, p. 5) stresses that global strategy is more than international business – it focuses on strategies of multinational corporations, and is in essence, a strategy for the global marketplace. Many authors acknowledge that global strategy is technically a subset of international strategy, but it is currently used as the generic term (Segal-Horn and Faulkner 2010, p. 19). Verbeke (2013, p. 4) defines international business strategy as: effectively and efficiently matching an MNE’s internal strengths (firmspecific advantages relative to competitors) with the opportunities and challenges found in geographically dispersed environments that cross international borders (location advantages). It is also important to understand the role of international management in global strategy. This concentrates on personal-level issues including culture and communication, negotiations and leadership, human resources and talent management, and international marketing and distribution. The roles of the international managers and of possessing a global mindset are paramount for strategy.
LAYMAN’S TERMS: How is global strategy different from strategy? A global strategy is both “global” and “strategy”. It deals with the strategies of firms (multinational and local) in international environments. The basics of strategy might be the same (i.e. strategy purpose, process, content) but the international context is making it a more complex endeavour that requires understanding of the foundations of international business, the global business environment and of international management.

12	 Regional and global strategy
Semi-globalisation is a perspective that suggests that barriers to market integration at borders are high but not high enough to completely insulate countries from each other (Peng 2013, p. 13). In essence, we tend to overstate the extent to which the world is globalised, according to Ghemawat (2011). He gives an example of surveys he conducted with international managers who routinely over-report the degree to which various aspects of business and other activity is “globalised”. In particular, he criticises Friedman’s (2005) book The World is Flat for lacking data to back it up. E-tool: www.ghemawat.com devoted to global strategy, including DHL Global Connectedness Index Exercise: Try to estimate how much of world trade, FDI flows, portfolio equity stocks, internet traffic and phone calls is international (across national borders) and how much is domestic.

Rugman and Verbeke (2004) have also been critical of the globalisation hypothesis. They claim that most of the world’s largest corporations are not global but rather confined to the region of their origin: Europe, North America or Asia-Pacific. They call these three key regions the triad. They also argue for using hard data to test the extent to which firms are “global” or “regional” in their operations. They use sales location as a measure of a firm’s globalisation, and find that 70–80% of sales from the world’s largest 500 companies (Fortune Global 500) stay within their home triad region. They classify MNEs into four categories: 1.	 Global – having >20% of sales in each of the Triads, but <50% in any of the Triad regions 2.	 Bi-regional – having >20% of sales in two Triads, but <50% in any of the Triad regions 3.	 Host-region oriented – having over 50% in a Triad market other than their home region 4.	 Home-region oriented – having at least 50% of sales in their home Triad region They found that of the world’s largest 500 MNEs, only 9 were “global”, 25 bi-regional and 11 host-region oriented in 2001. They suggest that too much global diversification in sales may have managerial pitfalls (making it more complex, difficult and costly to manage far-flung operations). Their findings were later challenged by Osegowitsch and Sammartino (2008), who used different thresholds (10% instead of 20%) and dropped the 50% home region threshold. Using these different metrics, they found that there were 24 global firms and a trend towards more globalisation. However, subsequent research by Rugman and Oh (2012) found that both sales and assets of MNEs have remained largely regionalised in 2000–2007, with both staying at about 75–80%. Exercise: Check a recent annual report of one of the only 9 truly “global” firms identified by Rugman and Verbeke (2004). What is the most recent data on its regional/global dispersion of sales, assets and profits? Is the firm getting more “global” over time and what does this say about “global strategy”?
LAYMAN’S TERMS: How is global strategy different from regional strategy? Ghemawat (2005) outlines what he calls “regional strategies” for global leadership. He says that embracing regional strategies requires flexibility and creativity. A company must decide what constitutes a region, choose the most appropriate strategies, and mesh those strategies with the organisation’s existing structures. In a world that is neither truly global nor truly local, finding ways of coordinating within and across regions can deliver a powerful competitive advantage.

13	 Global strategy frameworks
In chapters 15–17 we will cover three leading perspectives on global strategy. Peng (2015, p. 16) calls them a strategy tripod because this framework has three theoretical “legs”: 1)	 Industry-based view: the key strategic task is to examine the competitive forces affecting an industry, and to carve out a position that is less vulnerable relative to these forces 2)	 Resource-based view: this concentrates on the internal strengths and weaknesses of the firm, positing that it is firm-specific capabilities that differentiate successful firms from failing ones 3)	 Institution-based view: we also need to take into account the influences of formal and informal “rules of the game” to explain differences in firm strategy and how firms behave Bartlett and Beamish (2015) outline four broad approaches that firms can take to being international. They view the “transnational” mentality and strategy as the “solution” and most evolved of the four:

Source: adapted from Segal-Horn & Faulkner (2010) and Bartlett & Ghoshal (1989) To become “transnational”, Bartlett and Beamish (2015) recommend building three layers of international competitive advantage (we will cover these in depth in chapters 18–20): 1)	 Developing a transnational organisation 2)	 Creating worldwide innovation and learning 3)	 Engaging in cross-border collaboration Verbeke (2013, p. 5) developed his own unifying framework for understanding international strategy. He stresses the role of recombining internationally transferable firm-specific advantages and (nontransferable) home- and host-country location advantages into a multinational network. Tallman (2009, p. 7) suggests that multinational strategy follows a standard strategic decision-making process, where the strategic mission, vision, objectives and goals are followed by strategic analysis, identifying strategic options, selecting one, and executing and evaluating the selected option. Review questions 1.	 Please explain the main differences between the different elements of the strategy tripod. 2.

Discussion question The four broad approaches to being international are often presented in a simplified way in a two by two matrix (see the figure below). The two key dimensions distinguishing the four strategies are “pressures for global integration” (vertical axis) and “pressures for local responsiveness” (horizontal axis) introduced in chapter 5. Think about the firms from Figure 12.2 and try to place one in each of the quadrants.

Foreign market entry

14	 Foreign market entry
What are the motivations for firms to go abroad? Why would some choose to stay at home? There are two underlying factors according to Peng (2014, p. 158): (1) size of the firm and (2) size of the domestic market. Large firms in a small domestic market are likely to be more enthusiastic internationalisers. Example: Nestlé, based in Switzerland which has a population of 8 million, sells food brands globally. On the other side of the spectrum are small firms in a large domestic market, which are likely to stay at home or be “occasional internationalisers” because of their relatively poor resource base and the large size of their domestic market. Example: most US SMEs are local or export only to one market.7 X-FACTOR DATA

Foreign market entry involves strategic decisions about where, how and when to enter a foreign market. According to Peng (2014), underlying each decision is a set of strategic considerations drawn from his “tripod”: •	 Industry-based considerations on the degree of competitiveness (see chapter 15) •	 Resource-based considerations on firm-specific assets (see chapter 16) •	 Institution-based considerations on country risks (see chapters 6 and 17)

Foreign market entry

Where to enter? Location is an important and often neglected factor in international business.8 Two sets of considerations drive the location of foreign entries, according to Peng (2014): 1)	 Location specific advantages and strategic goals. Favourable locations in certain countries may give firms operating there location specific advantages. These need to be matched with strategic goals: resource-, market-, efficiency- or innovation-seeking (see Figure 14.3). 2)	 Cultural/institutional distances and foreign entry locations. Another set of considerations centres on cultural/institutional distances (see also ch. 17). Cultural distance is the difference between two cultures along some identifiable dimensions such as individualism or masculinity.9 Institutional distance is “the extent of similarity or dissimilarity between the regulatory, normative and cognitive institutions of two countries”, according to Xu and Shenkar, 2002. Two schools of thought have emerged relating to the distance concepts and international business. 1)	 Cultural proximity. The first is associated with the Stages models (the Uppsala model of “gradual” internationalisation, see Part I). It argues that firms will enter culturally similar countries during their first stage of internationalisation, and that they may gain more confidence to enter culturally distant countries in later stages (Peng 2014, p. 166). Example: Swedish H&M expanded first in Scandinavia, before countries in the rest of Europe and in Northern America. 2)	 Markets & efficiency. A second school of thought argues that considerations of strategic goals such as markets and efficiency are more important than cultural/institutional considerations.10 Example: natural resource seeking firm Rio Tinto from Australia entered culturally distant Mozambique to mine titanium.

Overall, in the complex analysis underpinning entry decisions, location represents but one of several important considerations. Entry mode and timing are also crucial.

LAYMAN’S TERMS: location specific advantages and country specific advantages. Location specific advantages can be linked to sub-national regions, cities and clusters, not just countries. A cluster/agglomeration is a geographic concentration of related companies, organisations, and institutions in a particular field that can be present in a region, state, or nation.

E-tools: clusters. An excellent resource on US clusters is Michael Porter’s US cluster mapping project: http://clustermapping.us/. For clusters in Europe check out: http://www.clusterobservatory.eu/index. html. For research on other clusters worldwide see for example: http://www.isc.hbs.edu/resources/Pages/publications.aspx?HBSFormat=Print&HBSTopic=Clusters%20 %26%20Cluster%20Development How to enter foreign markets The decision about how to enter foreign markets initially boils down to an equity (ownership) issue. Non-equity modes are modes of foreign market entry that do not involve the use of capital. These include exports and contractual agreements, such as franchising. They tend to reflect relatively smaller commitments to foreign markets. Example: US Starbucks enters some markets through franchising. It has over 200 franchised and licensed coffee shops in the UK and that number is growing. Exercise: How do you buy a Starbucks or other franchise? Check out this link and find out more about franchising: www.thefranchiseking.com/how-to-buy-a-starbucks-franchise.Which of the franchising opportunities on the website seem interesting to you and why? Equity modes are modes of foreign market entry that involve the use of capital. They include joint ventures (JVs) and wholly owned subsidiaries and are indicative of relatively larger commitments. Example: French retailer Carrefour has entered a number of markets through JVs (Turkey, Taiwan).
FOCUS: French retailer Carrefour (the world’s second largest retailer after US-based Wal-Mart) announced in 2011 plans to strike up a strategic joint venture with its biggest rival in Brazil, Grupo Pao de Açúcar. Carrefour’s stock price gained 3.7% on hopes of higher profits as the move would create the biggest retail business in the South American country. Carrefour’s French rival Casino was the largest shareholder in Grupo Pao de Açúcar. Its shares fell 5.6% after the JV was announced.

Verbeke (2013) suggests that there are three related aspects of foreign entry mode dynamics: •	 Foreign distributors (why MNEs establish long-term relationships with local distributors, even when they also command a wholly owned distribution network) •	 Strategic alliance partners (how MNEs select wholly owned affiliates versus alliances and develop an understanding of the main benefits and risks of alliances) •	 Mergers and acquisitions (how international mergers and acquisitions can create economic value for the firm in spite of challenges with management biases, governance and integration)

Fig 14.5 The choice of entry modes: a decision model (adapted from Peng 2014)

The decision between equity and non-equity modes is not trivial. In fact, the distinction traditionally defines an MNE: An MNE typically enters foreign markets via equity modes through FDI (Peng 2014, p. 171). Relative to a non-MNE, an MNE has three principal advantages: ownership, location and internalisation advantages (OLI advantages discussed in chapter 4) related to directly owning assets overseas, operating in specific locations and replacing external markets with in-house links.

Foreign market entry

During the second step of the foreign entry mode decision process (see Figure 14.5), managers consider variables within each group of non-equity and equity modes. Each of these has pros/cons. Some scholars have suggested that the OLI framework is more applicable to traditional, Western MNEs than to emerging multinationals from countries such as China, Russia or Brazil (Peng 2012). While these MNEs, like their developed country counterparts, look for attractive locations and internalise transactions – conforming to the L and I parts of the OLI framework – they typically do not own better proprietary technology, and their management capabilities are usually not world class.11 Linkage, leverage and learning (LLL) framework tries to make sense of these emerging MNEs.12 Linkage refers to an emerging MNE’s ability to identify and bridge gaps. Leverage refers to an emerging MNE’s ability to take advantage of their unique resources and capabilities (typically based on a deep understanding of customer needs). Learning refers to the motivation to “go global” to learn skills such as transparent governance, market planning, and management of a multicultural workforce.

FOCUS: Are emerging MNEs lacking in technology? Chinese telecom giant Huawei led international patent filings in 2014, as the total number of patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty reached a record high of 214,500. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, Huawei applied for 3,442 patents, edging out US chipmaker Qualcomm and Chinese competitor ZTE with 2,409 and 2,179 applications, respectively. With 61,492 patent applications, the US was the primary origin of patent applicants ahead of Japan (42,459) and China (25,539). Among the top 10 filing countries, China was the only country to see double-digit growth in 2014, as the country’s efforts to foster home-grown innovation are paying off.

Tallman (2009, p. 182–189) synthesised market entry strategies into these four groups: 1.	 Market strategies (no direct investment needed: including exporting, licensing, franchising) 2.	 Cooperative entry strategies (including both non-equity alliances and equity joint ventures) 3.	 Entry through acquisition (mergers of “two equals” and acquisitions by a dominant partner) 4.	 Entry by start-up (greenfields: building own operations from scratch with whole ownership)

Industry and competition

15	 Industry and competition
Analysis of industry and competition is a part of business strategy. These can be applied to international and global settings to form global competitive analysis. However, when doing so, two aspects must be considered (Tallman 2009, p. 71). First, in relation to global markets, it is essential that the global scope of such industries be matched by analysis of global competitors. Second, when entering new local markets, firms should conduct local competitive analysis – keeping in mind that any local market may be influenced by competition in the international market. Example: When US fast-food chain Subway enters a market such as France, it needs to consider both global rivals (such as KFC) and local competition (e.g. Flunch). E-tool: Map of Subway’s worldwide locations: http://chartsbin.com/view/e4b The Five Forces framework developed by Michael Porter from the Harvard Business School is a key framework of the industry-based view of strategy.14 It is based in the industrial economics tradition, in particular drawing on the structure-conduct-performance model that suggests that industry structure determines firm conduct (strategy), which in turn determines firm performance.15 The Five Forces model (Porter, 1980) suggests that firm performance critically depends on the degree of competitiveness of these five forces within an industry (see Figure 15.1 below): 1.	 Rivalry among competitors – the possibility that direct competitors will be unable to coordinate actions and will compete away profits among themselves 2.	 Threat of new entrants – the possibility that as more firms enter the industry, increasingly competitive markets will reduce profit potential 3.	 Bargaining power of suppliers – the possibility that specialised suppliers will have increased bargaining power and will extract excess profits from the industry 4.	 Bargaining power of buyers – the possibility that a limited set of customers will have the bargaining power to extract excess profits for themselves 5.	 Threat of substitutes – the possibility that new products or technologies will make existing firms obsolete When industry structure is favourable, incumbents (existing firms) can stay profitable for extended periods. If some of the five forces are strong, industry profitability can be depressed. The challenge is to stake out a position that is less vulnerable to attack from old and new opponents and less vulnerable to erosion from buyers, suppliers and substitutes (Porter 1980; Peng 2014, p. 43).

Its operating profit grew 65% from US$11.4 billion to US$18.8 billion from 2013 to 2014 while industry-wide profits grew 31% in the same period. Android hardware vendors (mainly Samsung) combined took a record-low 11% of the global smartphone profits, down from 29% a year ago. BlackBerry, Windows Phone and others recorded profits close to zero that quarter.

After identifying the five forces underlying industry competition, the next task is to make strategic choices. Porter (1985) suggested three generic strategies to strengthen a firm’s competitive position: 1.	 Cost leadership: a competitive strategy that centres on competing on low cost and prices. 2.	 Differentiation: strategy of delivering products that customers see as valuable and different. 3.	 Focus: a strategy that serves the needs of a particular segment or niche of an industry. E-tool: check out this video explaining Porter’s generic strategies in an entertaining, visual and clear way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V14kuqYEsxE Examples: Ryanair (Ireland) operates through cost leadership in the European airline industry. Onitsuka Tiger (Japan) produces distinctively styled and vibrantly coloured shoes and clothing blending urban and sports looks. Embraer (Brazil) focuses on medium sized aircraft production instead of jumbo jets. Exercise: choose the airline, shoe or aircraft industry and try to think of a company that has used a different strategy from Ryanair, Onitsuka or Embraer yet still succeeded within that industry.

Strategies of internationalization and globalization are driven by industry conditions, as in an industrydriven model of configuration and coordination (Porter 1986). This model builds on the Five Forces Model and concepts of global integration and national responsiveness (chapter 5). Porter recognises explicitly that concentration of activities and geographical dispersion are not necessarily mutually exclusive. He suggests that industries can be characterised by two dimensions: 1.	 Configuration: ranges from geographically concentrated to dispersed in many nations. Where in the world is a firm’s activity performed, and in how many places? 2.	 Coordination: ranges from low integration across markets to high global coordination. How are the firm’s international activities coordinated when they are done in many places? Porter (1986) describes four strategies corresponding to each of the cells of the framework: 1.	 International strategies emphasise home-based economies of scale, with most production based in and serving the home location whilst international markets are served largely by casual exports – requiring little international coordination across markets 2.	 Multi-domestic strategies refer to industries with dispersed configuration and low coordination characteristics that favour nationally responsive strategies, with activities widely spread and operated independently – most local markets are served by local production

3.	 Simple global strategy refers to industries prone to high concentration and high coordination, in which activities are concentrated often in the home market and other major markets – combining location advantages with scale economies, and coordinated across markets 4.	 Complex global integration refers to industries with dispersed configuration and high coordination – here managers balance demands for efficiency with demands from location for adaptation and comparative advantage benefits from siting different stages of production in different locations

Debates and extensions of the industry-based models (Peng 2014, pp. 48–54): •	 Clear vs blurred boundaries of industry (such as between smartphones and computers) •	 Threats versus opportunities (the Five Forces may be seen as opportunities not threats) •	 Sixth force: complementors (firms selling products that add value to the focal firm’s products) •	 Stuck in the middle vs all-rounders (successful firms that are cost leaders and differentiators) •	 Industry rivalry vs strategic groups (groups of firms within a broad industry – e.g. ultra-luxury) •	 Integration vs outsourcing (less integration and more outsourcing might be advisable) •	 Industry-specific vs firm-specific and institution-specific performance determinants Implications: •	 Establish an intimate understanding of your industry by focusing on the Five Forces •	 Be aware that additional forces may influence the competitive dynamics of your industry •	 Firms may do well in a structurally unattractive industry

Resources and capabilities

16	 Resources and capabilities
While the industry-based view focuses on how industry structure and competition affect firm performance, the resource-based view is more concerned with how individual firms differ within one industry.16 It suggests that differences in firm resources and capabilities are the most fundamental drivers of differences in firm performance.17 Resources and capabilities: tangible and intangible assets a firm uses to choose and implement its strategies (Peng 2014, p. 64). Tangible assets are observable and more easily quantifiable. They include: •	 Financial resources and capabilities (e.g. capital resources and financing options) •	 Physical resources and capabilities (e.g. plant, property and equipment) •	 Technological resources and capabilities (e.g. software and database management systems) Intangible resources and capabilities are harder to observe and difficult to quantify and codify. They include: •	 Human resources and capabilities (management know-how and organisational capabilities) •	 Innovation resources and capabilities (patents, research and development capabilities) •	 Reputation resources and capabilities (brand and marketing capabilities)

PwC (2005) stresses the importance of IP value management in China as opposed to the traditional concerns about IP protection. IP value management is a holistic approach to IP rights, which re-engineers core business strategies and operations to cultivate and preserve value in ways that are resistant to the value-eroding global and market forces.

Resources and capabilities

The resource-based view attributes the achievement of competitive advantage to the particular qualities, resources and capabilities of the firm, rather than to market positioning (Segal-Horn & Faulkner 2010). A firm’s unique organisational resources, also called capabilities or core competencies, are the key sources of sustained competitive advantage, as they are not easily acquired or imitated by competitors. Verbeke (2013) also stresses that organisational routines – the distinct ability to combine organisational resources in unique ways valued by customers – are very difficult to imitate. Overall, it is important to consider the value (V), rarity (R), imitability (I), and organisation (O) aspects of resources and capabilities, also called the VRIO Framework.18

Fig 16.3 VRIO framework (adapted from Barney 2002 and Peng 2014)

LAYMAN’S TERMS: Don’t confuse resources and capabilities. Although many authors use these two terms interchangeably, resources are often more static in nature while capabilities are relatively more dynamic and evolving. Capabilities are often linked organisational resources and routines (such as organisational culture and systems) that are more difficult to imitate than physical or human resources. In other words, capabilities are organisational skills and not just a resource base.
Table 16.1: The VRIO Framework: Is a resource or capability valuable, rare… (adapted from Peng, 2014)

One of the most important considerations in applying the resource-based view to global strategy is outsourcing: “turning over all or part of an activity to an outside supplier to improve the performance of the focal firm” (Peng 2014, p. 69). Example: the manufacturing of many branded products such as Puma or Adidas shoes is outsourced to suppliers in low-cost countries. In recent times, service activities such as call centres, IT, HR and logistics are also being outsourced. It’s not only large MNEs that outsource; SMEs use outsourcing to grow globally too, allowing some sole-proprietor firms to break US$1million in sales.19 It is also important to distinguish between outsourcing, which can be done within a single country, with offshoring to foreign locations, and captive sourcing, which involves setting up subsidiaries in foreign locations to perform in-house work. This captive sourcing is essentially identical to foreign direct investment.

FOCUS: Outsourcing woes of 787 Boeing Dreamliner. Over 70% of the value of Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner was provided by outside suppliers, including engineering work in USA, Australia, France, Japan and Italy. This was a much higher share than in the previous airplanes of the company where less than 50% was outsourced. While outsourcing was supposed to reduce the 787’s development time from six to four years and cut development costs by 40%, the end result was the opposite. The project was billions of dollars over budget and over three years behind schedule (Denning 2013). However, outsourcing was not the only reason for 787’s problems. The core problem was perhaps that Boeing modularised a complicated innovation project too soon. In the creation of a truly new product, it is an advantage to start out as integrated as possible (Allworth 2013).

Fig 16.5 Boeing

The resource-based view can also be understood within a framework of objectives of multinational business strategies (Tallman 2009, pp. 23–36) entailing: •	 the search for international markets (by leveraging resources and capabilities) •	 the international search for innovation (to build resources and capabilities) •	 international risk reduction objectives (to protect resources and capabilities) Tallman (2009, pp. 99–112) further extends his analysis of firm-specific resources and capabilities in the global setting by applying them to multinational strategy via capability leveraging and building: •	 Capability leverage strategies – leveraging existing resources and capabilities implies static sources of advantage based on firm-specific resources and capabilities derived from the home market. International markets represent opportunities to further leverage assets and capabilities which have been successfully exploited in the home market. Example: UnderArmor sports gear first developed itself as a successful US company, before leveraging this success when moving abroad later on.

•	 Capability-building strategies – most long-term successful multinational firms also build capabilities through their international operations, and an essential activity in the firms is to possess assets and capabilities that can be leveraged on an ongoing basis. Dynamic capabilities suggest a process of interaction between firm-level initiatives and environmental pressures. Example: HSBC bank, founded in Hong Kong, has built its dynamic capabilities in its London headquarters.

In the retail industry, for example, Swedish IKEA became a global phenomenon, while US giant Wal-Mart Stores stayed largely local and withdrew from Germany and South Korea. Domestic resources and cross-border capabilities don’t always have to be the same.

Exercise: Explain how concepts and ideas from this section can explain IKEA’s relative success and WalMart’s relative failure in global markets. Implications: •	 Managers need to build valuable, rare, non-imitable and organisationally feasible resources. •	 Competitor imitation or benchmarking is unlikely to be a successful strategy. •	 Managers need to build up resources and dynamic capabilities for future competition. Review questions 1.	 Explain the VRIO framework. How does it help us to analyse firms’ global competitiveness? 2.	 What is the difference between outsourcing and offshoring? Explain using Boeing as a case. 3.	 Explain the difference between tangible and intangible assets and give some examples.

Institutions and ethics

17	 Institutions and ethics
The institution-based view argues that in addition to industry- and firm-level conditions, firms also need to take into account influences from sources such as the state and society when crafting global strategy as institutions and ethics often differ vastly across countries and societies (Peng 2014, p. 94). Institutions are the “rules of the game” – humanly devised constraints that structure human interaction. They were popularised by Douglass North, a Nobel laureate in economics.20 They can be formal (laws, regulations, rules) and informal (norms, cultures, ethics). Richard Scott, a leading sociologist, outlined three pillars that support institutions: 1.	 Regulatory (how formal rules, laws and regulations influence our behaviour) 2.	 Normative (how the values, beliefs and norms of other relevant players influence us) 3.	 Cognitive (the internalised, taken-for-granted values and beliefs that guide our behaviour) Institutions are expected to reduce political and economic uncertainty. By signalling which conduct is legitimate and which is not, institutions constrain the range of acceptable actions.

Uncertainty surrounding economic transactions can lead to transaction costs, which are defined as the costs associated with economic transactions – or more broadly, the costs of doing business. E-tool: Doing Business, a World Bank sponsored project, provides objective measures of business regulations for local firms in 189 economies and selected cities at the subnational level. It looks at domestic small and medium-sized companies and measures the regulations applying to them through their life cycle. The various regulations and other costs of doing business are major obstacles to international growth of SMEs in particular. For more details see: http://www.doingbusiness.org/ Exercise: Select a country that you are not familiar with. Check the Doing Business website and try to find resources and intelligence that would help you understand what the costs of doing business there would be. Can you name three major hurdles an SME from your country would face in that other country? Do the parties to business exchange operate harmoniously, or are there frequent misunderstandings and conflicts? If there is too much friction the economic mechanism can get “jammed,” like an unlubricated car, and grind to a halt (Williamson 1985). Opportunism – deceitful behaviour – is an important source of transaction costs. Examples: misleading, cheating, and confusing other parties in transactions (such as investment scams).
FOCUS: the largest investment scam in world history originated in the United States. Bernie Madoff, a New York self-styled financier, ran what he pretended to be a sophisticated hedge fund, attracting personal investment from wealthy Americans while promising them over double digit returns. His investors included celebrities such as movie director Steven Spielberg, actress Uma Thurman and TV personality Larry King. In the end, Madoff lost over $10 billion after the fund was found to be a Ponzi (pyramid) scheme, in which returns and payments to old investors are paid for by incoming funds from new investors. The collapse of the investment scheme compounded the effects of the demise of the Lehman Brothers investment bank and exacerbated the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–2009. This had negative effects worldwide, as investors lost faith in the institutions and ethics underpinning the global capitalist system (Maglich 2013).

Institutions and ethics

How do institutions reduce uncertainty for investors? There are two ways this occurs: Arm’s length transaction – a formal, rule-based, impersonal exchange with third-party enforcement (courts, lawyers, police) – is one institutional mode of exchange governing business relationships. Relational contracting, on the other hand, reduces uncertainty through transactions based on mutual trust and informal relationships. Example: these informal relationships are a major part of doing business worldwide and take various forms such as guangxi in China, blat and svyazi in Russia and old boy networks in the UK/USA. The following figure highlights the relationships between firms, their strategic choices and institutions:

Fig 17.2 Institutions, firms and strategic choices (adapted from Peng 2014)

A key proposition of the institution-based view is that while formal and informal institutions combine to govern human behaviour, in situations where formal constraints are unclear or fail, informal constraints will play a larger role in reducing uncertainty for managers and firms (Peng 2014, p. 102). Ethics: norms, principles, and standards of conduct governing individual and firm behaviour. Code of conduct: written policies, standards and guidelines for corporate conduct and ethics. Example: IKEA code of conduct: http://ww.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/our_responsibility/iway/ index.html

Institutions and ethics

Multinational enterprises face more challenges in managing ethics, as what is considered “normal” in one country may be considered “unethical” elsewhere.21 Three schools of thought exist on this issue: Ethical relativism: “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.” Ethical standards vary significantly around the world, thus there are no universally agreed upon ethical and unethical behaviours. Ethical imperialism: “There is one set of Ethics – ours.” The “imperialistic” thinking that one’s own ethical standards should be applied universally around the world. Middle-of-the-road: Some principles apply universally (respect for human dignity and basic rights for example) but firms also need to be sensitive and respect local traditions and institutional context.22 Corruption is one of the most contentious issues in the ethics of global business. It is defined as the abuse of public power for private benefit usually in the form of bribery (in cash or kind).
FOCUS: When in Russia, do as the Russians do? IKEA, a Swedish retail giant with global operations, learned about the importance of institutions and ethics when it expanded into Russia, a country with vastly different “rules of the game” compared to Sweden (McCarthy & Puffer 2008). While bribes are almost unheard of in Sweden, they are commonplace in Russia. When the expansion of IKEA in Russia was held up by bureaucracy and a bribe-seeking power company, one of its Russian staff apparently sped up the process in the “Russian way” by paying the utility firm officials “an extra”. When this came to the public’s attention in Sweden, two IKEA officials were fired as a result.

18	 Organisation and structure
It is crucial to build an organisation that is able to deliver the strategic capabilities required to be successful globally. This chapter builds on the concepts of global integration and local responsiveness and the four approaches to being international (Bartlett & Beamish 2015) we previously introduced. Global strategy (also called global standardisation) focuses on the world and standardised products. Multi-domestic strategy (also called localisation) focuses on countries/regions and local adaptation. International strategy (also called home-replication) focuses on international replication of home competencies. Transnational strategy is an MNE strategy that tries to be cost efficient, locally responsive and learning-driven.
LAYMAN’S TERMS: global vs transnational strategy. While these two terms sound similar, global strategy focuses on global standardisation and largely treats the world as one unit. Transnational strategy considers the costs and benefits of global standardisation, but strives to be responsive to differences among regions and attempts to derive learning advantages from an international presence.

Organisation and structure

The four strategic choices typically lead to the adoption of corresponding organisational structures:

Fig 18.1 Strategies and structures (adapted from Peng 2014)

International division structure: an organisational structure typically set up when firms initially expand abroad, often engaging in a home replication strategy. Geographic area structure: an organisational structure that organises the MNE according to different countries and regions. This is the most appropriate structure for a multi-domestic strategy. Example: General Motors and its German Opel, British Vauxhall and Australasian Holden divisions. Country (regional manager): a business leader is assigned to be in charge of a specific country (or region) for an MNE. This is typically associated with a geographic area structure. Global product division: an organisational structure that assigns global responsibilities to each product division. Example: Philips has global divisions for healthcare, lighting and consumer goods. Centres of excellence: MNE subsidiaries explicitly recognised as a source of important capabilities, with the intention that these capabilities be leveraged by and/or disseminated to other subsidiaries. Example: Chinese Huawei opened a global finance centre of excellence in London, UK.

FOCUS: Tata International. Karan, an Indian student who was about to finish his Master of International Business degree in New Zealand, was considering internship opportunities in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. After studying about the rise of emerging giants – MNEs from emerging markets – he realised that his “golden opportunity” might be closer to home. He picked up the phone and after an interview process landed an internship and later a full time job with Tata International. Tata International is a global trading and distribution division of India’s Tata Group. It leverages the group’s global presence and marketing capabilities across five business lines: metals; leather and leather products; agricultural trading; distribution; and minerals.

Global matrix: an organisational structure often used to counter the disadvantages associated with both geographic area and global product division structures, especially for MNEs adopting a transnational strategy. Example: Swiss food giant Nestlé used this structure. See exercise below. Exercise: Observe and analyse Nestlé’s organisational structure via the link below. Is it driven more by geographic area or global product divisions or both? Research recent changes made to it. What reasons did the management give for these changes? http://www.nestle.com/aboutus/management Global account structure: a customer-focused structure that supplies customers (often other MNEs) in a coordinated way across various countries.23 Example: Flextronics and Hewlett-Packard Solutions-based structure: an MNE organisational structure that caters to the needs of customers by providing solutions to their problems. Example: IBM One of the leading debates on how to manage large firms is centralisation (corporate controls) versus decentralisation (subsidiary initiatives). Subsidiary initiative is a proactive and deliberate pursuit of new business opportunities by an MNE’s subsidiary to expand its scope of responsibility. The subsidiary’s initiatives may lead to chaos if they are not in line with the corporate HQ’s overall policies. As Andy Grove, former chairman and CEO of Intel, said, the challenge of corporate management is:

“Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos – repeatedly.” (Burgelman & Grove 2007).
FOCUS: Emerging multinationals moving their headquarters to developed countries. It is unusual for MNEs to be so transnational that they move their HQ overseas, but some of them do. HSBC (Hong Kong), SABMiller (South Africa), Anglo American (South Africa), and Old Mutual (South Africa) have all moved their headquarters to London and Chinese Lenovo moved its HQ to Raleigh, North Carolina in the United States. However, some companies are reassessing their choice. HSBC has hinted several times that it might relocate its headquarters from London to Hong Kong (a trend often referred to as “re-shoring” back to the home location).

Fig 18.4 HSBC

Exercise: Research one of these MNEs’ websites and try to explain why they moved their HQ abroad. Implications: •	 Come up with the right strategy-structure configurations based on your industry’s evolution. •	 Master the external rules of the game governing MNEs and home/host country environments. •	 Be prepared to change the internal rules of the game governing MNE management. Review questions 1.	 Which organisational structures correspond to the four approaches to being international? 2.	 What is the difference between a global account structure and solutions-based structure? 3.	 Would you rather work in a subsidiary of a foreign multinational operating in your country or for a local multinational company from your country with operations abroad? Why?

Knowledge and innovation

19	 Knowledge and innovation
Underpinning the emphasis on worldwide innovation and learning is the emerging interest in knowledge management. This may be defined as the structures, processes, and systems that actively develop, leverage and transfer knowledge (Peng 2014, p. 310). Explicit knowledge: knowledge that is codifiable (that is, it can easily be written down and transferred without losing much of its richness). Example: much IT knowledge, such as software code. Tacit knowledge: knowledge that is not codifiable (that is, difficult to write down and be transmitted without losing much of its richness).24 Example: experiential leadership and organisational skills. Knowledge management goes beyond information technology, it also depends on informal social relationships within the MNE.25 The table below sums up knowledge management in four MNE types:

Fig 19.1 Knowledge management in four types of MNEs (adapted from Peng 2014 Bartlett & Ghoshal 1989)

Globalising research and development Relative to production and marketing, only more recently has R&D emerged as an important function to be internationalised – often known as innovation-seeking investment.26 The intensification of competition for innovation drives companies to seek a foreign country’s local talents and expertise. Example: many MNEs such as Swiss Nestlé have opened R&D centres in Singapore. Nestlé’s Singaporebased R&D centre serves fast growing markets in Asia-Pacific and works on eco design.

Global virtual teams: teams whose members are physically dispersed in multiple locations in the world. They cooperate on a virtual basis.
FOCUS: Procter & Gamble (P&G), a producer of fast moving consumer goods such as Head and Shoulders shampoo, in 2000 launched the Connect and Develop programme with the goal of generating more than half of the company’s innovations from outside sources. The programme sped up the process of innovation, resulting in an almost 60% increase in innovation productivity. Their innovation success rate more than doubled, while the cost of innovation fell. More than 35% of their new products in the market had elements originating from outside P&G in 2005, up from around 15% in 2000. Check out this P&D website inviting individuals to submit their innovation ideas to the firm: http://www. pgconnectdevelop.com/home/submit_innovation.html.

Worldwide innovation and learning Bartlett and Beamish (2014, p. 393) suggest that traditionally, MNEs’ innovative capabilities were dominated by one of two classic processes: In the centre-for-global innovation model, the new opportunity is sensed in the home country. The centralised resources and capabilities of the parent company are brought in to create the new product or process, usually in the main R&D centre. Implementation involves driving the innovation through subsidiaries whose role it is to introduce that innovation to their local market. Example: Pfizer’s development of the drug Viagra at its US HQ, followed by sales worldwide. In contrast, local-for-local innovation relies on subsidiary-based knowledge development. Responding to perceived local opportunities, subsidiaries use their own resources and capabilities to create innovative responses that are then implemented in the local market. Example: Dutch Unilever’s development of a detergent bar in response to the Indian market’s needs. The key challenges of the centre-for-global innovation model include making central innovations effective by: •	 Gaining subsidiary input through multiple channels •	 Responding to national needs through market mechanisms •	 Managing responsibility transfer through personnel flow The key challenges in making local-for-local innovations efficient are: •	 Empowering local management •	 Linking local managers to corporate decision-making processes •	 Integrating subsidiary functions

Knowledge and innovation

In recent years, the traditional models have evolved into two new processes: Locally leveraged innovation involves ensuring that the special resources and capabilities of each national subsidiary are available not only to that local entity, but also to other MNE units worldwide. Example: the world’s best-selling phone at the time, the Nokia 1100, was developed in 2003 specifically for the Indian market. Globally linked innovation pools the resources and capabilities of many different units – typically at both the parent company and the subsidiary level – to create and manage an activity jointly (Bartlett & Beamish 2014, p. 397). Example: P&G’s introduction of an improved liquid laundry detergent deliberately drew on the diverse technological capabilities being applied separately to its products sold in Europe, Japan and the US. Realistically, a one-size-fits-all approach to capturing the benefits of innovation will not work in a large MNE. The most effective way to exploit (technical) knowledge within an organisation depends on the complexity of the technology itself and the understanding of the focal market. In practice, the best way to capture innovation varies. Sometimes it may be to move people, and at other times to move or exchange information (Santos, Doz & Williamson 2005).

Alliances and collaboration

20	 Alliances and collaboration
Strategic alliances are voluntary agreements of cooperation between firms. They are a compromise between market transactions (such as exporting) and mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Equity-based alliances (involving an ownership stake) include strategic investment (one partner invests in another), cross-shareholding (both partners invest in each other), and joint ventures (a new independent firm whose equity is provided by two or more partners). Contractual alliances (without an equity stake) include co-marketing, research and development (R&D) contracts, turnkey projects, strategic suppliers, strategic distributors, licensing and franchising.

Fig 20.1 Advantages and disadvantages of strategic alliances (adapted from Peng 2014)

Strategic network (sometimes called a constellation27) is a strategic alliance formed by multiple firms to compete against other such groups and against traditional single firms (Peng 2014, p. 190). Example: The Star Alliance includes airlines Lufthansa, Swiss, United, Air China and Air India etc.

Alliance formation How are alliances formed? Figure 20.2 illustrates the three stages of alliance formation: •	 Stage 1: To cooperate or not to cooperate? International growth by market transactions can be highly demanding, even for resource-rich multinationals. M&As are also costly and can be highly complex. •	 Stage 2: Contract or equity? The driving forces of the choice between contract and equity involvement include the: (1) nature of shared resources capabilities; (2) importance of direct organisational monitoring and control; (3) influence of formal institutions. •	 Stage 3: What kind of relationship? Firms are likely to have multiple inter-firm relationships and they need to be managed as a corporate portfolio or network of alliances. Figure 20.3 explains factors affecting alliance partner selection based on two dimensions: (1) partner comfort and (2) partner competence. There is no real upside to selecting a partner who is competent but with whom you may not be comfortable working. Nor, however, should partners be selected on the basis of comfort rather than competence.

Alliance evolution There are three key issues relating to alliance relationships, according to Peng (2014, p. 203–206): 1.	 Combating opportunism (cheating), e.g. by blocking off critical capabilities 2.	 Using both strong (long term, durable) relationships and weak (infrequent, low intimacy) ties 3.	 Managing corporate marriage through to divorce (planning for and managing potential alliance dissolution or partner exit) Hamel, Doz and Prahalad (1989) draw these lessons for international strategic alliances: •	 Collaboration is competition in a different form •	 Harmony is not the most important measure of success •	 Cooperation has limits •	 Learning from partners is paramount

FOCUS: Why did Danone’s JVs in China turn sour? From 2007 to 2009, Danone, a French multinational food company, was in a fierce battle with Chinese Wahaha Group (the largest beverage producer in China) to win control of their joint ventures in China. Danone discovered financial irregularities in its Chinese joint ventures, and the legal battle that ensued involved disputes about brands and perceived levels of commitment to the joint ventures. Lawsuits were launched both in China and internationally. Finally, Danone resolved a long-running dispute with its Chinese joint venture partner in late 2009, agreeing to exit the venture by selling its 51% stake in Wahaha.

Segal-Horn and Faulkner (2010) suggest that just as network theory and strategic alliance became popular phrases to describe the growing intra-organizational forms of the 1990s, the virtual corporation in its varied forms makes claims to fill that role in the 2000s. The virtual corporation differs from the strategic alliance in that it places its emphasis not primarily on how two or more firms can work together to their mutual advantage, but on how one firm can be created with flexible boundaries and ownership. This firm is supported by electronic data exchange and information and communication technologies. Example: Italian clothing giant Benetton carries out about seven-eighths of its activities through externally employed virtually connected parties, allowing it to focus only on core activities such as design.

Synergy: The combination must have the potential to create more value than the parties could create on their own. 2.	 Unity: The combination must be designed and managed to realise the joint value. 3.	 Contribution: The value earned by the parties must motivate them to contribute to the collaboration. Implications •	 Relational (collaborative) capabilities are crucial for the success of alliances and networks •	 Understand and master the rules of the game governing alliances and networks worldwide •	 Carefully weigh the pros and cons of alliances vis-à-vis those of acquisitions •	 Alliances can be relatively easy to form – but may not be the best solution •	 Alliances need not be permanent •	 Flexibility in alliance relationships is key •	 An international knowledge network is a basis for learning
