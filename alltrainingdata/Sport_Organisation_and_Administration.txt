Sport Organization

1	 Sport Organization
1.1	Introduction
The extension of professional events, professional sport organizations, private sport clubs, health centers, corporate sponsorships and the media has turned sport into a major social phenomenon.

1.2	

What is a sport organization?

Definition of a sport organization: “A sport organization is a social entity involved in the sport industry; it is goal-directed, with a consciously structured activity system and a relatively identifiable boundary” From the above mentioned definition, there are five key elements, namely: 1.	 Social entity ¾¾ All sport organizations are composed of people or groups of people who interact with each other to perform those functions essential to the organization. 2.	 Involvement in the sport industry ¾¾ Sport organizations are differentiated from other organizations such as banks, car dealerships etc. because of their direct involvement in one or more aspects of the sport industry, for example, through the production of sport-related products and services. 3.	 Goal-directed focus ¾¾ All sport organizations exist for a purpose, be it for making a profit, encouraging participation in a given sport, or winning Olympic medals. 4.	 Consciously structured activity system ¾¾ The interaction of people or groups of people in sport organizations occur through conscious structuring of activity systems such as marketing, product and service development, financial development and human resource development. 5.	 Identifiable boundaries ¾¾ Sport organizations need to have a relatively identifiable boundary that distinguishes members from nonmembers. The elements of the definition are evident in the sport organization, Nike. The goals of the company are to produce athletic footwear and to sell it at a profit. As Nike has grown and more people have been hired, activity systems have been consciously structured, for example, marketers and financial managers have been hired. The people hired identified themselves as employees and managers of Nike, which creates for them an identifiable boundary to differentiate their company from its competitors in the athletic footwear industry.

Organization structures
Type of structures

There are different types of structures a sport club can choose from to exist. In this section there will be looked at three structures, namely sole proprietorship, partnership and nonprofit organizations. 1.3.1.1	 Sole proprietorship A sole proprietorship is a business owned by one individual. The club owner may have staff members, but the owner controls all decisions within the organization. All the profit from the club venture goes to the owner and therefore is not subject to corporate income tax, but is reported on the owner’s personal income tax.
Example of a proprietorship Mike Muscles has his own supplement business where he supplies supplements to body builders. Mike has one staff member that works for him by delivering the supplements to the clients. He would generate income for himself and report what he made after expenses associated with the club on his personal income tax annually. Mike would make all the decisions in relation to the business because he is the owner. If Mike would sell a defect product to a client he can be sued as an individual by the client. He alone is then responsible for all damages or losses and can lose everything, his business and other personal property not related to the business such as his house, savings and other investments.

Advantages of a sole proprietorship ¾¾ The owner has total control over all decisions related to the business ¾¾ Easy to establish ¾¾ All profits retained by the owner ¾¾ Easy to sell ¾¾ Fewer government restrictions ¾¾ Is not subjected to corporate income tax ¾¾ Great flexibility Disadvantages of a sole proprietorship ¾¾ Limited managerial experience ¾¾ Owner is alone responsible for the business ¾¾ Lasts as long as the owner lives ¾¾ Limited access to capital funds

1.3.1.2	 Partnership A partnership is a business owned by two or more people with the goal of providing services that will be profitable for the partners. This business structure is similar to a sole proprietorship, but it involves more than one person. The resources the partners bring to the partnership may came in the form of capital, expertise or labour.
Example of a partnership Mike Muscles has decided to expand his business by producing more services and products. He approached Dave Dumbbell to partner with him into a partnership. They planned to open a gymnasium where people can gym and buy the supplements. The reason why Mike approached Dave is that Dave can give the capital to build the gym. Mike has the expertise of running a gym as well as selling the supplements. Because it was Mike’s idea to expand the business they agreed on a partnership of 60/40%. Mike will own 60% of the business and Dave 40%. By having the majority stake, Mike will have more control of the business. When dividing the profit, Mike will get 60% and Dave 40%.

Advantages of a partnership ¾¾ It is cheap and simple to establish ¾¾ All the owners have some control over the decisions that are made ¾¾ Revenues are taxed only once ¾¾ All profits are divided according to owners shares ¾¾ Various expertise involved in the business Disadvantages of a partnership ¾¾ Limited access to capital funds ¾¾ Lasts only as long as the partnership survives ¾¾ It is difficult to dissolve a partnership if one of them dies or withdraws from the partnership. 1.3.1.3	 Nonprofit organizations A nonprofit organization is a corporation that exists for charitable, religious, educational, or scientific purposes and thus is exempt from some federal income taxes. A sport club can be designed to meet one of these criteria. A nonprofit organization is overseen by a board of directors and guided by a set of bylaws compiled by the board. The makeup of the board and the terms of each position on the board are outlined in the bylaws. The executive director of the club reports directly to the board of directors.

Advantages of a nonprofit organisation ¾¾ The organization is exempt from certain taxes ¾¾ Any donations to the organization is tax deductible for the donor ¾¾ A diverse board of directors offers oversight Disadvantages of a nonprofit organization ¾¾ There is no true ownership of the club 1.3.2	 Dimensions of organization structures

In this section there will be looked at the three most common dimensions that are used in organizations, namely specialization, formalization and centralization. 1.3.2.1	Specialization Specialization concerns the division of labor, or the extent to which tasks and duties are divided into separate roles. When specialization is high, employees carry out a limited range of tasks and duties, and when specialization is low, individual employees carry out a wide range of tasks. The dimension of specialization is tied to the concept of complexity. There are three levels of complexity, namely vertical, horizontal, and spatial. Vertical complexity Vertical complexity is evidenced by the number of levels that exist between the top executive in the organization (president, chairperson) and the lowest positions and units in the hierarchy (departments). The more levels there are, the more vertically complex the organization is, and the more communication, supervision and coordination problems can occur. The number of levels in the organization is usually related to the size of an organization and can be in the form of a flat or tall structure.

Horizontal complexity Horizontal complexity is shown in the number of units and sub-units that exist across the organization, for example there is a financial department, marketing department and a production department in the organization. The financial department has sub-units such as a unit that handles all the purchases, one that handles all the creditors etc. Spatial complexity Spatial complexity refers to the number of places in which the organization operates. An organization operated in more than one place would be considered spatially complex relative to an organization operating in a single location, for example the sport shop Sportsman warehouse is more spatial complex than Kloppers, because they have a lot of branches in South Africa.

1.3.2.2	Formalization Formalization refers to the amount of written documentation in an organization such as rules and regulations, job descriptions, policies and procedures. If a sport organization is highly formalized it will have lots of rules and regulations, comprehensive policies and procedures, and detailed job descriptions to guide its operations. In this type of organization, employees have little discretion over how and when they do their work. In sport organizations with low formalization employees are given the freedom to exercise discretion about their work, and when and how it is carried out. 1.3.2.3	Centralization Centralization refers to the hierarchical level that has authority to make a decision. When leaders and managers at the top of the hierarchy handle the decision-making activities, the organization is considered centralized. When decision making is delegated to levels throughout the organization, the organization is decentralized. Organizations are not completely centralized or decentralized. Some decisions in the organization may be centralized, for example the hiring and firing of employees, whereas other decisions may be decentralized such as the purchasing of supplies. Factors that determines if decisions are centralized or decentralized: ¾¾ The cost of the decision to the sport organization – the greater the cost, the more centralized the decision will be. οο Example, a decision must be made to put up new flood lights on the hockey field. The costs of new flood lights are very high and therefore the decision will be centralized. ¾¾ The timing, how much time a sport manager has to make a decision – the more urgent the decision, the more decentralized it will be. οο Example, there are not enough netball balls to play matches the following week. The sport manager must make an immediate decision on purchasing new balls. ¾¾ The qualifications of employees – the greater the number of expert employees involved in the sport organization, the more decentralized the decision will be, because expert / skilled employees have more freedom to decide how to do their work. The structural elements of a sport organization show how the work of the sport organization is broken down and the means used to integrate the different tasks. It is essential that sport managers understand the various elements of structure to be effective and efficient sport managers.

Organizational and Management Theories

2	Organizational and Management Theories
2.1	Introduction
The sport club environment consists of many sport organizations on several levels. Some clubs consist of one coach with a team of 15 players competing in a league; others are large organizations with many full time staff members and many members. In this chapter there will be looked at the different management theories related to sport clubs.

2.2	

Organizational theories

A sport club can be viewed in two ways – from an organizational theorist view or an organizational behaviorist view. Organizational theory focuses on the larger organization, whereas organizational behavior emphasizes the small group or individual within the organization.

Organizational and Management Theories

DEFINITIONS: Organization theory  A theory that focuses on the nonhuman concepts of an organization such as goals, systems, structures, policies and “ procedures” Organizational behavior “A theory that focuses on the individuals within the organization and how their behavior affects the organization”  Management “ The ability to get people to achieve organizational objectives through planning, organizing, leading and control” 

2.3	

Management theories

There are three management theories that can be applied to a sport club. In this section there will be looked at the works and ideas of Frederick W. Taylor, who was the first to view management as a science; Peter Drucker, who introduced management by objectives; and W. Edwards Deming, who devised the model of total quality management. 2.3.1	 Management as a science

The beginnings of management theory rest with Frederick W. Taylor, long considered the father of scientific management. Taylor was born on the 20th March 1856 in Philadelphia. He was a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. Taylor asserted that an organization cannot prosper unless the employees of the club prosper as well and for an organization to achieve maximum prosperity, according to Taylor’s system, managers must apply the following principles: ¾¾ Develop a science for each element of a man’s work ¾¾ Scientifically select and then train, and develop employees instead of requiring employees to choose their areas and train themselves ¾¾ Provide the employee with detailed instructions and supervision on how he must conduct his work ¾¾ Divide work nearly equally between managers and workers, so that the managers apply scientific management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks.

Organizational and Management Theories

Taylor believed in transferring control from workers to management. He set out to increase the distinction between mental (planning work) and manual labor (executing work). Detailed plans specifying the job, and how it was to be done, were to be formulated by management and communicated to the workers. Taylor further believed the laborer was worthy of his hire, and pay was linked to productivity. Taylor died at the age of 59 on 21st March 1915. 2.3.2	 Management by objectives

Peter Drucker was born on 19 November 1909 in Kaasgraben, Vienna. He was a writer, professor and management consultant and did some exploration on how people organize themselves. He developed the management by objectives theory that entails the following: “A management theory designed to encourage collaboration between management and employees to achieve success” According to Drucker’s theory, objectives must be realistic, achievable, measurable and motivating, otherwise they are meaningless. He further postulated that individual objectives must also align with the organization’s overall objectives to achieve overall success. Drucker believed that organizations are most effective when they are decentralized and when employees are skilled to perform the tasks. According to Drucker, skilled employees are one of the most important aspects in the success of an organization. Applying Drucker’s theory to the sport club would entail the club leadership in collaboration with the board and staff establishing goals and objectives for staff members, departments of the club, and the overall club. Drucker died in 2005 at the age of 95.

Total quality management

W. Edwards Deming was born on 14th October 1900 in Sioux City, Iowa. He was a statistician, professor, author, lecturer and consultant. Deming has developed the total quality management theory that is based on management instilling a sense of purpose in employees and developing a positive environment through consensus building and collaboration between management and employees. Total quality management is a management philosophy that is driven by competition and customer needs. Deming believed that profound knowledge, statistics, psychology and an understanding of a system is required for the achievement of quality. Managers who adhere to total quality management focus on the education and training of employees and believe that the club can always get better by listening to employees to determine how to make the club better. Total quality management is therefore about promoting quality throughout the organization so that in the end the club members are satisfied. Deming died on 20 December 1993 at the age of 93.

3	 The Club
3.1	Introduction
The foundation of the modern sport club is to understand why the club exist, what it aspires to be, and what goods and services it provides to its members. The reality is that sport clubs have become businesses, some nonprofit and others for profit, that are accountable to their players, members and state and national governing bodies. The objective of this chapter is to provide the outline for the structure of a sport club.

3.2	

The club plan

The club plan is a written document that stipulates all aspects of a club’s purpose and structure. The main elements of a club plan are a philosophy, vision statement, mission statement, goals, policies and procedures, club governance and organization structure.

3.2.1	Philosophy A philosophy is the beliefs, values, and truths that define a person or organization and distinguishes right from wrong and good from bad. Your philosophy is the system of principles that gives you direction in answering questions about what, why, and how. We all have philosophies about many things. Your most important philosophy concerns your beliefs about what you value in life and what type of person you strive to be. As a sport manager of a sport club you need to have a philosophy for your club or program that you run. Your club philosophy consists of principles that serve as your guide to administering the club, helping you make daily decisions. As you administer your club, these formative principles will be tested when you confront situations in which you are uncertain about the best way to respond. When you do respond, you will evaluate the consequences of your actions against your principles. Developing a club philosophy involves three steps: STEP 1: Determine the objectives your club would like to achieve STEP 2: E  stablish the principles you want to use to guide you and your staff in managing the club STEP 3: Form a set of coherent policies The overall philosophy of the club has to be fashioned by the club’s leadership and accepted by all staff and coaches, thereby enabling it to penetrate to the club’s players and parents.
Example of a club philosophy A club committed to promoting excellence in the educational, character, and physical development of members by offering a rigorous and challenging sport experience. Sport will be used to instill the qualities of leadership, teamwork, dedication, perseverance, loyalty, and fair play. These values will be tested and strengthened in the heat of the competition. Participants will learn to cope with success and failure and to be humble in victory and proud in defeat, and will understand that the competition is preparing them for the ultimate competition: life.

The above philosophy statement communicates clearly the club’s belief that sport has the power to affect people and reaches beyond the playing field. These beliefs should drive all other aspects of the club. For the club to thrive, players, parents, coaches, management, and staff must buy in and live it on a daily basis. 3.2.2	 Vision statement

A vision statement is a conceptual vision of what the club aspires to be, based on its philosophy. The vision should be both ambitious and compelling and should spell out what the club hopes to become, their dream to be in the future. The vision is the end and not the means of getting to the end.
Vision statement of Tjokkers Hockey Club The Tjokkers Hockey Club shall provide coaching, training and development of recognized excellence to schools in Potchefstroom. Hockey Tjokkers is committed to becoming the leader in hockey coaching in the North-West Province.

A vision statement should contain four distinct elements: ¾¾ The provider of the service (Tjokkers Hockey Club) ¾¾ The service to be provided (coaching and training) ¾¾ The target clients (schools in Potchefstroom) ¾¾ A quality declaration that identifies aspirations for how internal and external audiences will receive the program Reasons why a vision statement is important ¾¾ It portrays the dream that the club has for the future ¾¾ It promotes change ¾¾ It provides the basis for a strategic plan ¾¾ It enhances a wide range of performance measures ¾¾ It helps to keep decision making in context ¾¾ It motivates individuals ¾¾ It has positive consequences The vision statement guides the formulation of the mission statement and therefore the vision statement should be clear to develop the mission statement. 3.2.3	 Mission statement

A mission statement is a statement of intent that provides meaning, purpose, and direction to members, employees, and leaders of the club. Purposes of a mission statement ¾¾ It provides a snapshot of the club for potential employees and club members ¾¾ It provides purpose, meaning and direction to members and employees of the club ¾¾ It provides direction for club leaders, guiding them in decision making Components of a mission statement ¾¾ The particular services to be offered ¾¾ The goals of the club ¾¾ The philosophy of the club ¾¾ The desired program image based on feedback from stakeholders

Mission statement of Tjokkers Hockey Club The mission of Tjokkers Hockey Club is to provide youth hockey players ages 5–18 a place to play hockey and to receive quality coaching in a safe and positive environment. The club is a family friendly organization that offers both recreational and league hockey as well as camps and clinics for members. Players of all skill levels are encouraged to play, and the club strives to conduct all business in a professional, fair and customer-friendly environment that puts the interest of the players first.

3.2.4	

Goals and objectives

Goals are an extension of the vision and mission statements of a club and provide sport managers with an understanding of the direction to take in the club. Goals and objectives can be applied to any area of the club such as revenue, membership, performance standards, facilities, and programs offered and can be applied to individuals in the club as well as to the club as a whole. it is important to understand the difference between goals and objectives.
Goals “states general targets to be accomplished” Objectives “states what is to be accomplished in specific and measurable terms by a certain target date”

Goals are your target; objectives guide your development of operational plans and help you know if you are achieving the target. Goals thus translate into objectives.

Writing objectives Goal: to increase membership 1.	 Start with the word to: To ------2.	 Attach an action verb, typical ones are increase, improve, enter, and revive: ---increase--3.	 Think of a single, specific result that you want to achieve and that can be measured: ---membership with 10%--4.	 Choose a target date: During the 2014 hockey season Objective: To increase membership with 10% during the 2014 hockey season. Criteria to write objectives An objective must lead to a single result that is specific and measurable and must include a target date. 1.	 Single result Write each objective so that it describes only one result. Aim for clarity and simplicity Poorly stated objective:  to increase sales by 25% and to achieve a 5.4% market share. (Sales of what? Market share of what? By when?) Well stated objective: to increase tennis racket sales by 25% by December 2014. 2.	 Specific result State the exact level of performance expected. Poorly stated objective:  to maximize profits in 2014 (how much is maximize? Is this gross profit or net profit?) Well stated objective: to earn a net profit of R500 000 in 2014 3.	 Measurable result Your objective must be measurable to determine if it has been met. Poor stated objective:  perfect service for every customer (perfect by whose standards? how do you measure perfect service?) Well stated objective: to attain 90% “excellent” in customer satisfaction ratings in 2014. 4.	 Target date Set a date for accomplishing the objective. Deadlines makes you focus earlier and try harder. Poorly set objective: to achieve attendance of 70 000 fans (for every game? for all time?) Well set objective: to achieve attendance of 70 000 fans for the 2014 hockey season.

When a goal is met, it is time to move on to new goals. If a goal is not met, the club can reset the parameters of the goal or look at the club to determine why the goal was not met and decide how to meet it in the future. 3.2.5	 Policies and procedures

Once the club leaders understand the purpose and goals of the club, they must communicate what must be done and how it will be done. This is accomplished through the development of policies and procedures.
Policies: “general statements of organizational intent that may be both internally and externally focused” Procedures: “statements on how policies will be achieved that make the actions of a club standardized”

Example of policy and procedure Tryouts Policy: An independent panel will oversee tryouts and select the players for a team. Procedure:  The panel will consist of five members – two coaches from another age group, the director of coaching, a board member, and the head coach. Behavior on the field Policy: participants may not swear or present bad behavior on the field Procedure:  participants behaving badly or swear on the field will face a disciplinary committee who will decide what the penalty will be. Policies and procedures can be created to address the following aspects of a club: ¾¾ Financial ¾¾ Purchasing ¾¾ Travel ¾¾ Equipment ¾¾ Facilities ¾¾ Emergency plans ¾¾ Team selections ¾¾ Leagues and competitions ¾¾ Coaching

Establishing policies and procedures makes the decision making processes easier on the staff and members of the club. Instead of having sole responsibility for player selection, the coach merely has to follow the established policy and procedure. 3.2.6	 Club governance

The governance structure of a club should be documented and followed and the role of the board and its committees should be clearly communicated. Articles of incorporation Articles of incorporation are the formal, legal description of a business and contain the following: ¾¾ Club name and structure type ¾¾ Name(s) of person(s) organizing the club ¾¾ Whether the club is a stock or nonstock corporation ¾¾ Purpose for formation ¾¾ Names of members of the board of directors ¾¾ Address of the club’s registered office ¾¾ Accounting period the club will use for reporting purposes

Board of directors The board of directors of a club is an important entity whose main function is to ensure that the club achieves its stated purpose. The following information regarding the board of directors should be clearly communicated in the constitution of the club: ¾¾ The role of the board ¾¾ Number of members ¾¾ How one is placed on a board ¾¾ Grounds for dismissal ¾¾ The term of board membership ¾¾ Officer positions on the board ¾¾ The role of each position on the board Responsibilities of an effective board of directors ¾¾ Determine the club’s mission and purpose ¾¾ Select the executive director ¾¾ Support the executive director and review his or her performance ¾¾ Ensure effective planning ¾¾ Ensure adequate resources ¾¾ Determine the club’s services and programs ¾¾ Enhance the club’s public image Committees A committee is an entity created for the purpose of carrying out assigned responsibilities within a given area of a club. An effective board of directors establishes a committee structure to handle the specific aspects of the club. Committees may include fund-raising, new membership, strategic planning, budget, facilities, tournaments, and public relations. Each committee focuses on its specific area and reports back to the board on its activities. Requirements for an effective committee ¾¾ Appoint a balanced group. ¾¾ Committees of three to five members function effectively. ¾¾ A chairperson or a convener should be appointed for convening the group. ¾¾ The duties of each committee member must be made clear ¾¾ Set dates for the completion of their work ¾¾ Appoint someone to record the work of the committee

Club structure

To be efficient and effective, a sport club must have a structure that assigns task to various units or personnel in the club. Task assignments are presented in job descriptions and are easily understood through the use of an organizational chart that shows the reporting lines for the organization and who is responsible for what. The most effective way to structure a sport club is by function or task. Clubs can have a simple or complex structure. Simple club structure: ¾¾ Club has only a few full-time staff members ¾¾ Only one or two people have all the authority to run the club ¾¾ The reporting lines are very short Complex club structure: ¾¾ Club has many full-time employees ¾¾ Employees has specialized responsibilities ¾¾ Reporting lines are longer The key to an effective structure is grouping similar tasks and having employees performing those tasks report to a supervisor who oversees the area. For example, a club may separate its structure into coaching and tournaments. The coaching function will include all coaching related aspects, like coaching the different ages, coaching clinics, coaching camps etc. The tournaments function will include all tournament related aspects such as travelling arrangements, accommodation, leagues and other competitions. One person or a department may handle each of those areas; the head coach of the club may oversee the coaching side of the club and the administrator of the club may oversee the tournaments side of the club. The chairperson of the club would have the responsibility of overseeing both aspects of the club.

4	 Groups in Sport Clubs
4.1	Introduction
Kids learn to work with each other when they join a club. They learn there are good times (winning games and laughing) and bad times (losing games and getting hurt), but either way they learn to stand with each other. Teamwork is very important for athletic performance and the same teamwork skills need to be applied to sport management. Clubs are increasingly using groups as their fundamental unit of organizational structure to respond more flexibly and quickly to rapidly changing environments. Thus, teamwork skills are becoming more important, and recruiters are looking to hire job candidates with the ability to work well with teams.

4.2	

Groups and teams

Although we often use group and team interchangeably, they are different. All teams are groups, but not all groups are teams. A team is a special kind of group, and turning groups into teams is a process that requires special management skills.

1. Club context A number of factors in the club and the environment, called context, affect how groups function and their level of performance. These factors are as follows: ¾¾ Environment ¾¾ Mission ¾¾ Strategy ¾¾ Culture ¾¾ Structure ¾¾ Systems and processes ¾¾ Goals ¾¾ Policies and procedures ¾¾ Rules and regulations ¾¾ Clubs resources 2. Group structure Each group has a certain structure that determines how individual group members and the group as a whole function. Factors that influence a group’s structure The factors that influence a group’s structure are group type, size, composition, leadership, and objectives. Group type Group types can be formal or informal, functional or cross-functional, and command or task. As sports organiser you need to understand the different types of groups that you will be part of during your career. Formal groups: ¾¾ Are created by clubs as their official structures ¾¾ Departments of clubs, such as financial department ¾¾ There is a strong leader, such as a manager ¾¾ The skills of the members are random and varied ¾¾ Individual members are accountable and rewarded for their own performance Informal groups: ¾¾ Not part of the clubs official structure ¾¾ Are spontaneously created when members come together voluntarily ¾¾ Can be either interest groups or friendship groups

Group size The sizes of groups vary depending on their purpose. Groups tend to be larger than teams; groups with more than 20 members are groups rather than teams, because there are too many members to reach consensus on issues and decisions.
Advantage Small groups Large groups -	 Individuals can all contribute -	 Tend to be more productive than larger groups -	 Great variety of ideas and creativity -	 better in problem solving than smaller groups Disadvantage -	 limited ideas and creativity -	 overwork and burnout of members -	 tend to be slow -	 inhibit equal participation

Table 4.2: Differences between small and large groups

Composition of the group Group composition is the mix of members’ skills and abilities. Deciding whom to put on a project or a team is one of the biggest challenges facing a manager or team leader. When assembling teams, select people with complementary skills to maximize performance. Generally, diverse groups with a variety of skills and knowledge tend to be more effective than homogeneous groups. Leadership To a large extent, leaders provide and determine group structure. Teams succeed or fail based on critical leadership choices. The leader’s relationships with team members are different, and the relationships affect team performance. Generally, better relationships lead to higher performance. Objectives In groups, objectives are commonly very broad – usually about fulfilling the club’s mission. Teams frequently develop their own objectives and own them in a way that groups don’t. Setting and then achieving objectives lead increase confidence, motivation, and job satisfaction. Effective managers should guide their team in setting objectives that can be met, that are clear, and that can solve the problem. 3. Group processes Group process is the patterns of interactions that emerge as group members work together. Group dynamics is another word for group process. Dynamics are about how people work together as they get the work done, not the work itself. Components of group process dimensions The components of group process dimensions are group roles, norms, cohesiveness, and status.

Group roles Each member in a group fulfills a role, and each role carries a role expectation – the way that others believe a person should act in a given situation. Group roles are task, maintenance and self-interest.
Task roles -	 members do and say things that help to accomplish the group’s objectives -	 roles are describe as structuring, job-centered, production, taskoriented and directive
Table 4.3: Group roles

Maintenance roles -	 members do and say things that shape and sustain the group process -	 roles are described as consideration, employee-centered, relationshiporiented, and supportive

Self-interest -	 members do and say things that help the individual, but hurt the group -	 members put their own needs before those of the group

To be effective, groups need their members to focus on both their task roles and their maintenance roles while minimizing self-interest roles. As you strive to achieve objectives, you need to distinguish between self-interests that benefit both the individual and the club (win-win situations) and those that benefit the individual but hurt the club (win-lose situations). Group norms Norms are an important part of group process and develop over time. Norms are the group’s shared expectations of member’s behavior and determine what should, ought, or must be done for the group to maintain consistent and desirable behavior. Team norms develop in four situations: ¾¾ During practices ¾¾ During competition ¾¾ In social situations ¾¾ During the off-season Norms develop spontaneously as members interact. If working hard becomes a group norm, the entire group will perform to that expectation. Norms can be formal or informal. Formal norm: The first team must jog 5 × around the field to warm-up every practice. Informal norm: We all stay for a drink after a match. Norms may be written, communicated verbally, or even shared unconsciously by members of the group, but not every member of the group accepts norms to the same extent.

Group cohesiveness Group cohesiveness is the extent to which members stick together and develops because of the attraction that the group holds for the individual, and this attraction relates to the individual’s needs. The more cohesive the group, the more it sticks together as a team. Factors influencing cohesiveness ¾¾ Objectives οο The stronger the agreement and commitment made to achieve the group’s objectives, the higher the group’s cohesiveness. ¾¾ Size οο The smaller the group, the higher cohesiveness. Three to nine members appear to be a good group size for cohesiveness ¾¾ Homogeneity οο Generally, the more similar group members, the higher the group’s cohesiveness, and vice versa. The dilemma is that diverse groups usually make better decisions. ¾¾ Participation οο The more equal member participation, the higher the group’s cohesiveness.

¾¾ Competition οο If the group focuses on internal competition, members will try to outdo each other, and low cohesiveness results, but if the group focuses on external competition, members tend to pull together as a team to beat rivals. ¾¾ Success οο The more successful a group is at achieving its objectives, the more cohesive it becomes. Status within the group Status is the perceived ranking of one member relative to other members in the group. Group status depends on the group’s objectives, norms, and cohesiveness. Members who conform to the group’s norms typically have higher status than members who don’t. Factors that status is based on: ¾¾ Performance ¾¾ Job title ¾¾ Salary ¾¾ Seniority ¾¾ Expertise ¾¾ People skills ¾¾ Appearance ¾¾ Education High-status members have a major impact on the group’s performance. If high-status members support positive norms and high productivity, chances are the group will too. The most productive groups consist of members with equal or close to equal status, in which all members feel they are contributing. 4. Group development stages Groups go through developmental stages as they grow from a collection of individuals to a smoothly operating group or team. The stages of group development are orientation, dissatisfaction, resolution, production, and termination. The two variables identified through each stage of group development are competence and commitment. These two variables do not progress in the same manner. As figure 4.1 shows, competence continues to increase steadily through stages 1–4, whereas commitment fluctuates – it starts out high in stage 1, drops in stage 2, and then rises through stages 3 and 4.

Decision Making

5	 Decision Making
5.1	Introduction
Not all decisions made in sport clubs are long and complex. The decisions made in a sport club may range from deciding on the playing clothes of the club to organizing a major event. Decision making is a central aspect of the four fundamental management functions, namely planning, organising, leading and control. When managers perform these functions with skilled decision making, they will have fewer problems to solve. In this chapter we will look at the types of decisions you get, the conditions of decision making, the decision making process and techniques for improving group decision making.

5.2	

Types of decisions

Before looking at the types of decisions, you need to know the definition of decision making.
Decision making: “a decision is a judgment, a choice between alternatives”

Sport club managers use their judgment to make decisions about whether to hire or fire employees or to trade a player during a match etc. The decisions a manager makes can be categorized into two types: programmed and nonprogrammed. 5.2.1	 Programmed decisions ¾¾ Programmed decisions are repetitive and routine ¾¾ They are made on the basis of clearly defined policies and procedures ¾¾ Types of problems to be solved using programmed decision making are usually well structured, have adequate information available and present clear alternatives ¾¾ There are definite methods for obtaining a solution to some decisions ¾¾ Are generally made by the club’s lower-level managers and operators ¾¾ Examples of programmed decisions in a sport club οο The decision to have more medical staff the bigger the tournament οο The decision of the rugby coach on the next play οο The admission of athletes to the club

Decision Making

5.2.2	

Nonprogrammed decisions ¾¾ Nonprogrammed decisions are new and unique ¾¾ Decisions are novel and ill structured, complex and elusive ¾¾ There are no established guidelines or procedures to direct the way this type of decision should be handled ¾¾ Often sport clubs has never faced decisions about this exact situation ¾¾ There are no clear alternatives from which to select ¾¾ Managers at all levels of the club make nonprogrammed decisions.

5.3	

Decision making conditions

By identifying the type of decision, as well as the conditions under which it will be made, managers should be able to make better decisions. The conditions under which decisions are made are certainty, risk, and uncertainty. 5.3.1	 Certainty

A decision is made under conditions of certainty when the available options and the benefits or costs associated with each are known in advance. In other words, the manager understands completely the available alternatives and the outcomes of each, with 100% certainty. Unfortunately, very few decisions in a sport club are made under conditions of certainty. 5.3.2	 Risk

Under the condition of risk, a decision maker has a basic understanding of the available alternatives, but the potential cost and benefits associated with each are uncertain. In other words, the manager does not know the outcome of each alternative in advance, but can assign a probability to each outcome. Decisions under conditions of risk are most common in sport clubs. 5.3.3	 Uncertainty

Under conditions of uncertainty the decision alternatives and their potential outcomes are both relatively unknown. In other words, the outcome of each alternative is unpredictable and managers cannot determine probabilities. Decisions made under conditions of uncertainty are the most difficult.
Certainty Decision maker has complete certainty Available options and the benefits or costs of each are known No element of change intervenes between the option and its outcome Decision is a sure thing Risk Decision maker has some certainty Outcome of each alternative is not known in advance Probability can be assigned to each alternative outcome Decision is a “gamble” Uncertainty Decision maker has no certainty Outcome of each alternative is unpredictable Probability cannot be assigned to each alternative outcome Decision is a “gut” feeling

The decision making process

The decision making process describes a set of steps that decision makers should follow in order to increase the probability that their decision will be optimal. STEP 1: Recognize, classify and define the problem ¾¾ Recognize that there is a problem ¾¾ Classify the problem in terms of the type of decision (programmed or nonprogrammed), and the decision making condition (certainty, risk, or uncertainty). ¾¾ Accurately define the problem ¾¾ Example, if a sport club needs a new pavilion for the spectators, the club must be in a position to explain the problem, e.g. the current pavilion is poorly designed and does not meet the needs of the club and spectators. STEP 2: Set goals and criteria ¾¾ Generally in programmed decisions the criteria can be found in policies ¾¾ In the case of nonprogrammed decisions, no goals or criteria have been set ¾¾ The manager will be responsible for this task and he / she can make an individual decision or involve a group in decision making ¾¾ Example: is time of the essence in making the decision about the need for a new pavilion? Is there a cost issue to consider? What is the budget for this facility?

Step 3: Developing and evaluating alternatives ¾¾ For every problem or issue, various alternatives may be available ¾¾ Alternatives may include what type of facility will be build and where the facility will be located ¾¾ Innovation and creativity play a major part in developing various alternatives ¾¾ Using groups to generate solutions could enhance this process ¾¾ The number of available alternatives identified is limited by time and money ¾¾ Each alternative should then be evaluated in terms of its strengths and weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages, benefits and costs. Step 4: Select the best alternative ¾¾ The decision is made at this step ¾¾ This step requires a manager to evaluate each alternative carefully against the goals and criteria set during the second step ¾¾ Rank the alternatives in order of priority ¾¾ The manager’s experience, values, internal politics and so on influence his choice. Step 5: Implementing the alternative ¾¾ Once an alternative has been selected, appropriate actions should be taken to ensure that it is properly implemented ¾¾ During this stage you need to establish who needs to be involved in implementing the decision and how this decision can be best implemented ¾¾ Decisions should be explained in such a way that all relevant parties understand them Step 6: Conduct follow-up evaluation ¾¾ Once a decision has been set in motion, evaluation is necessary to provide feedback on its outcome ¾¾ Adjustments are invariably needed to ensure that actual results compare favorably with planned results ¾¾ Questions to be answered in this step are: οο Did the decision lead to the intended outcomes? οο Was it the best decision given the circumstances? οο What were the final costs of building the pavilion?

Techniques for improving group decision making

Group decision making can enhance the process of setting goals and criteria and generating alternatives in the decision making process. Group decision making has certain advantages and disadvantages. Advantages ¾¾ A variety of skills and specialized knowledge can be used to solve a problem ¾¾ Multiple and conflicting views can be taken into account ¾¾ Beliefs and values can be transmitted and aligned ¾¾ More organization members will be committed to decisions, since they have participated in the decision making process ¾¾ Participation in problem solving and decision making will improve the morale and motivation of employees ¾¾ Allowing participation in problem solving and decision making, trains people to work in groups Disadvantages ¾¾ It can be more time consuming and can lead to slower decision making ¾¾ Groups are more likely to satisfice than an individual ¾¾ One group member may dominate the group decision ¾¾ It may inhibit creativity and lead to conformity 5.5.1	 Techniques for decision making

Various techniques have been suggested to make group decision making more creative in order to overcome the disadvantages and to capitalize on the advantages of group decision making. The following three techniques will be discussed in this section, namely brainstorming, the nominal group technique and the Delphi technique. Brainstorming Brainstorming is a technique used to stimulate creative solutions to organizational problems. Brainstorming is used to help groups generate multiple ideas and alternatives for solving problems. Process of brainstorming: ¾¾ A group is convened and the problem at hand is reviewed ¾¾ Individual members then are asked to silently generate ideas / alternatives for solving the problem ¾¾ These ideas are solicited and written on a board or flip chart ¾¾ Finally a second session is used to critique and evaluate the ideas ¾¾ Brainstorming sessions usually last from thirty minutes to an hour

Rules of a brainstorming session: 1.	 Defer the judgment ¾¾ Don’t criticize during the initial stage of idea generation ¾¾ Phrases such as “it won’t work”, “it’s too expensive” etc. should not be used 2.	 Build on the ideas of others ¾¾ Encourage participants to extend others ideas by avoiding “buts” and using “ands” 3.	 Encourage wild ideas ¾¾ Encourage out-of-the-box thinking ¾¾ The wilder and more outrageous the ideas, the better 4.	 Go for quantity over quality ¾¾ Focusing on quantity encourages people to think beyond their favorite ideas 5.	 Be visual ¾¾ Use different colored pens to write on big sheets of paper or white boards 6.	 Stay focused on the topic ¾¾ A facilitator should be used for keeping the discussion on target 7.	 One conversation at a time ¾¾ The ground rules are that no one interrupts another person, no dismissing of someone’s ideas, no disrespects, and no rudeness.

The Delphi Technique Decisions often have to be made by experts in different geographical areas. The Delphi technique is a decision making technique that does not require the physical presence of the participants. This technique is a group process that anonymously generates ideas or judgments from physically dispersed experts. Ideas are obtained from questionnaires as opposed to face-to-face group discussions. In this technique the group’s members never meet face to face. Process of the Delphi techniques ¾¾ The manager identifies the issue to be investigated ¾¾ Choose the experts to participate – there should be a variety of knowledgeable people in different areas ¾¾ Develop a questionnaire ¾¾ The questionnaire is sent to participants and returned to the manager (usually by e-mail) ¾¾ The manager then summarize the responses and sends feedback to the participants with appropriate new questions ¾¾ Participants are asked to οο Review the feedback οο Prioritize the issues being considered οο Return the survey within a specific time period ¾¾ The cycle repeats until the manager obtains the necessary information The Delphi technique is useful when: ¾¾ Face-to-face discussions are impractical ¾¾ Disagreements and conflict are likely to impair communication ¾¾ Certain individuals might severely dominate group discussion ¾¾ Groupthink is a probable outcome of the group process The Nominal group technique The nominal group technique helps groups generate ideas and evaluate and select solutions. This technique is a structured group decision making technique and restricts discussion or interpersonal communication during the decision making process. Group members are physically present, but members operate independently.

Decision Making

Process of the nominal group technique ¾¾ A group of 7–10 members is convened to discuss a particular problem ¾¾ After the problem is understood, individuals silently generate ideas in writing ¾¾ Each member then offers one idea from his or her list ¾¾ Ideas are recorded on a blackboard or flip chart and are not discussed at this stage ¾¾ Once all ideas are elicited, the group discuss them ¾¾ Anyone may criticize or defend any item ¾¾ Clarification is then provided as well as general agreement or disagreement with the idea This technique is appropriate for situations in which groups may be affected by a dominant person, Conformity, Or Groupthink, Because It Minimizes These Effects.

Conflict in Sport Clubs

6	 Conflict in Sport Clubs
6.1	Introduction
Conflict is an unavoidable aspect in any organization. Anyone who has been involved in any type of sport club, amateur or professional will have experienced the conflict that can occur in these clubs. A conflict exists whenever argument becomes antagonistic. When the issues are important and the opposing opinions strong, temperature rise and conflict can ensue. In this chapter we are going to discuss what conflict is, functional and dysfunctional conflict, types of conflict, the conflict process, and managing conflict.

6.2	

What is conflict?
1.	 The parties involved must perceive a conflict to exist 2.	 A conflict situation must involve two or more parties in opposition 3.	 One or more of the parties must be involved in preventing one or more of the other parties from achieving its goal by some form of blocking behavior. 4.	 This blocking behavior must result in frustration, anger, and some other form of emotional response.

For conflict to exist, there are four important aspects that must be present.

Definition of conflict: “conflict is a process in which one party perceives that its interests are being opposed or negatively affected by another party”

6.3	

Functional and dysfunctional conflict

There are two types of conflict you need to distinguish between, namely functional and dysfunctional conflict. Functional conflict is commonly referred to in management circles as constructive or cooperative and those engaging in functional conflict apply a win-win attitude to solve problems. Dysfunctional conflict is conflict that prevents groups from achieving their objectives and entails fighting and disruption. The distinction between functional and dysfunctional conflict pivots on whether the club’s interests are served. Functional conflict serves the clubs interest and dysfunctional conflict threatens the club’s interests. Certain situations produce more conflict than others. By knowing the antecedents of conflict, managers are better able to anticipate it and take steps to resolve it if it becomes dysfunctional. Situations tending to produce functional or dysfunctional conflict ¾¾ Incompatible personalities or value systems ¾¾ Overlapping of unclear job boundaries ¾¾ Competition for limited resources

Types of conflict

This section probes the nature and organizational implications of two basic types of conflict, namely personality conflict and intergroup conflict. 6.4.1	 Personality conflict

A personality conflict can be defined as interpersonal opposition based on personal dislike, disagreement, or different styles. Chronic personality conflict often begins with seemingly insignificant irritations. Traditionally, managers dealt with personality conflicts by either ignoring them or transferring one party. How to deal with personality conflicts Employees having a personality conflict ¾¾ Communicate directly with the other person to resolve the perceived conflict ¾¾ Avoid dragging co-workers into the conflict ¾¾ If dysfunctional conflict persists, seek help from direct supervisors or human resource specialists. Third-party observers of a personality conflict ¾¾ Do not take sides in someone else’s personality conflict ¾¾ Suggest the parties work things out themselves in a constructive and positive way ¾¾ If dysfunctional conflict persists, refer the problem to parties’ direct supervisors. Managers whose employees are having a personality conflict ¾¾ Investigate and document conflict ¾¾ If appropriate, take corrective action ¾¾ If necessary, attempt informal dispute resolution ¾¾ Refer difficult conflicts to human resource specialists or hired counselors for formal resolution attempts and other interventions.

Intergroup conflict

Conflict among work groups, teams and departments is a common threat to a club’s competitiveness. Sport managers who understand the mechanics of intergroup conflict are better equipped to face this sort of challenge. Cohesiveness can be a good or bad thing. A certain amount of cohesiveness can turn a group of individuals into a smooth-running team. Too much cohesiveness, however, can breed groupthink because a desire to get along pushes aside critical thinking. Changes associated with increased group cohesiveness ¾¾ Members of in-groups view themselves as a collection of unique individuals, while they stereotype members of other groups as being “all alike” ¾¾ In-group members see themselves positively and as morally correct, while they view members of other groups negatively and as immoral ¾¾ In-groups view outsiders as a threat ¾¾ In-group members exaggerate the differences between their group and other groups. An example of in-group thinking is sport fans that simply can’t imagine how someone would support the opposing team.

The conflict process

Often we tend to think of conflict situations as discrete events, the conflict occurs and then is resolved by some means. However, a conflict situation is made up of a series interrelated stages. By being aware of the stages of the conflict process, and consequently the conditions that produce conflict and the events that can trigger a conflict situation, sport managers can be in a better position to manage the incident. Pondy (1967) developed a five-stage model of conflict. Pondy’s Five-Stage Model of Conflict Stage 1: Latent stage of conflict ¾¾ Certain conditions frequently found in a club provide the latent potential for conflict to occur ¾¾ These conditions are condensed into three basic types of latent conflict, namely: οο Competition for scarce resources, for example when different departments of the club are vying for a portion of the club’s financial resources, there is a latent potential for conflict. οο Drive for autonomy, for example the coach of the u/16 team would like his team to wear white pants for their matches, but he may be constrained by the club’s constitution stipulating that the playing pants are black. οο Different goals that subunits within a club can have Stage 2: Perceived conflict ¾¾ One or more of the parties involved becomes aware of the potential for a conflict through some type of stimulus or information received ¾¾ Because clubs are often faced with more conflicts that they can handle, only a few are dealt with ¾¾ Conflicts that are dealt with are usually those for which routine solutions are available. Stage 3: Felt conflict ¾¾ During this stage emotions such as anger, hostility, and frustration are encountered Stage 4: Manifest conflict ¾¾ During this stage some sort of adversarial behavior are exhibited, ranging from apathy and rigid adherence to rules to violence and physical abuse.

Managing conflict

Conflict management is based on two dimensions, concern for others’ needs and concern for your own needs, which result in three types of behavior, namely passive, aggressive, and assertive. Taken together, these five components give us five different styles of conflict resolution that will be discussed in this section as well as how to stimulate functional conflict. 6.6.1	 Styles of conflict management

The following are conflict styles that sport club managers must be aware of. 1.	 Avoiding conflict style ¾¾ Some employees try to manage conflict by avoiding it ¾¾ They refuse to take a stand, withdraw mentally, or simply leave ¾¾ This approach is neither assertive nor cooperative, and it resolves nothing ¾¾ Both sides lose ¾¾ Passive behavior ¾¾ Avoider managers allow employees to perform poorly without confronting them Avoidance is appropriate when: ¾¾ the conflict is trivial ¾¾ your stake in the issue is not high (you have everything to lose and nothing to win) ¾¾ confrontation can damage an important relationship ¾¾ you don’t have time to resolve the conflict ¾¾ emotions are high (wait until everyone is cooled down)

2.	 Accommodating conflict styles ¾¾ People who resolve conflict by passively giving in ¾¾ Accommodators satisfy the other party but neglect their own needs in the process ¾¾ The opposing party wins; the accommodator loses ¾¾ Habitual accommodation maintains relationships by doing things the other person’s way ¾¾ As with avoiders, people also take advantage of accommodators Accommodation is appropriate when: ¾¾ You enjoy doing things for others (it’s part of friendship) ¾¾ Maintaining the relationship outweighs all other considerations ¾¾ The changes agreed to are not important to you but are to the other party ¾¾ Time is limited ¾¾ You have an autocratic boss who resolves conflict by force

3.	 Forcing ¾¾ People who use aggression to get their way resolve conflict by force ¾¾ Forcers are uncooperative and aggressive ¾¾ They do whatever it takes to satisfy their needs at the expense of others ¾¾ Forcers threaten, intimidate and call for majority rule when they know they will win ¾¾ They enjoy dealing with avoiders and accommodators because they are easy wins ¾¾ Forcers win; everyone else loses ¾¾ Forcers make enemies Force is appropriate in conflict resolution when: ¾¾ Unpopular action must be taken on important issues ¾¾ Maintaining relationships is not critical ¾¾ The conflict resolution is urgent ¾¾ You are dealing with an insubordinate employee 4.	 Negotiating ¾¾ People who resolve conflict through assertive give-and-take sessions ¾¾ Also called compromise ¾¾ Negotiations are both assertive and cooperative ¾¾ Everyone wins some and loses some ¾¾ Negotiators resolve conflict quickly ¾¾ Working relationships are maintained Negotiation is appropriate to use when: ¾¾ The issues are complex and critical and there is no simple, clear-cut solution ¾¾ Parties have about equal power and are interested in different solutions ¾¾ A solution will be only temporary ¾¾ Time is short 5.	 Collaborating ¾¾ People who jointly and assertively try to get the best solution that all parties can buy in to ¾¾ Collaborators are problem solvers ¾¾ They are both assertive and cooperative ¾¾ Collaborators are willing to change positions if a better solution is presented ¾¾ Collaboration is based on open and honest communication ¾¾ All parties win

Stimulating functional conflict

Sometimes committees and decision-making groups become so bogged down in details and procedures that nothing substantive is accomplished. Carefully monitored functional conflict can help get the creative juices flowing once again. Managers can resort to programmed conflict which is defined as “conflict that raises different opinions regardless of the personal feelings of the managers”. Programmed conflict techniques Two programmed conflict techniques of stimulating functional conflict are devil’s advocacy and the dialectic method. 1.	 Devil’s advocacy ¾¾ Involves assigning someone the role of critic ¾¾ This approach is intended to generate critical thinking and reality testing ¾¾ Rotate the job of devil’s advocate among the group ¾¾ Is good training for developing analytical and communicating skills and emotional intelligence

2.	 The dialectic method ¾¾ Is a time-honored practice ¾¾ This method calls for managers to foster a structured debate of opposing viewpoints prior to making a decision ¾¾ Requires more skill training than devil’s advocacy Managers have some latitude in using either devil’s advocacy or the dialectic method for pumping creative life back into stalled deliberations. The important thing is to actively stimulate functional conflict when necessary.

7.1	Introduction
The days of taking just anybody and letting them coach the youth is rapidly disappearing. Sport club managers can no longer place the health and well-being of youth in the hands of well-intentioned volunteers who are not competent in coaching the children. The purpose of this chapter is to help you effectively manage your coaches in your club by discussing the recruitment of coaches, selection of coaches, supervision and evaluation of coaches.

Recruitment of coaches

The most important element of a successful sport program is quality coaching, many other elements are necessary and important, but the coach makes or break the program. Recruiting coaches is a challenge for many sport clubs, and the challenge is getting these coaches to commit to your club. You need a recruitment plan that identifies the number of coaches you will need for each sport in your club, the activities you will initiate to recruit coaches, the time of year that you would initiate each recruiting activity, and the cost associated with each. In this section you will learn how to develop such a recruitment plan. Recruitment plan The following steps can be followed to compile a recruitment plan: Step 1:		 Step 2:		 Step 3:		 Step 4:		 Needs assessment Compile a job design and description Advertise Compile recruiting plans

Each step will be discussed in the following section. 7.2.1	 Needs assessment

You need to determine how many coaches you need for the up-coming season for each sport program at your club. To do that you can compile your own coaching needs assessment form, see form 7.1.

Job design and job description

Before you compile a job description you need to look at job design. The foundation of job design is skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and job feedback. When a job is well designed, the employee is motivated based on feelings of meaningfulness, responsibility, and knowledge of the results of his efforts. Skill variety Skill variety refers to “the degree to which a job requires a variety of different activities in carrying out the work, involving the use of a number of different skills and talents of the person”. Variety may relate to the number of tools and controls an employee uses or to the change in work pace, physical location, or physical operation. A good example is a club manager who oversees both the sport and business sides of a club.

Task identity Task identity refers to “the degree to which a job requires completion of a whole and identifiable piece of work; that is doing a job from beginning to end with a visible outcome”. An example of high task identity is a sport scientist in your sport club who evaluates the fitness level of a client, prescribes a gym program for the client, and leads and supervises the exercise session. A sport club manager who oversees participants registration, schedules the facility and games, administer the coaches, and organize the year-end function also has high task identity. Task significance Task significance refers to “the degree to which a piece of work is essential to the club achieving its mission and goals”. Every job should be designed so that the person in that job plays a part in achieving the mission and goals of the club, for example a club cannot achieve excellence unless the facility manager ensures the upkeep of the facility. Task autonomy Task autonomy refers to “the degree of freedom and independence employees feel in relation to their work and the control they have over how and when they do the work”. For example the coach of a hockey team has considerable autonomy in recruitment of players, methods of training, and competitive strategies. In contrast the club’s secretary has less autonomy, because the tasks she needs to do, how she carries out those tasks, and when she does the tasks are specified for her. Task feedback Task feedback is “the degree to which carrying out the work activities provides the individual with direct and clear information about the effectiveness of his or her performance”. Club managers need to communicate performance standards to employees, supervise them to be sure they understand the standards, and evaluate them to let them know whether they have met the standards. Example of a job design for a Director of Coaching
         Hire qualified coaches Assist with training and developing training sessions for coaches Facilitate coaching education opportunities Promote player development Attend games and tournaments to evaluate coaches Conduct game analysis with coaches Organize player clinics and camps Communicate with parents Serve as the liaison with the club’s board of directors

After compiling job design you need to compile the job description.

Selecting coaches

It is your responsibility as manager to make sure that you select the most qualified coaches from numerous candidates for your club. To have a quality program you must be selective and be sure that those you choose meet the minimum qualifications. The selection of coaches entails a screening process that is discussed in the next section. Screening process The screening process includes the following: 1.	 Review the applicants’ application forms ¾¾ The coaching committee reviews all applications ¾¾ Screen out those who do not meet the minimum qualifications 2.	 Briefly interview those candidates who meet the minimum qualifications ¾¾ The coaching committee can meet as a group to interview each candidate ¾¾ Interview needs to be extensive, usually 15 minutes is sufficient to evaluate the candidate ¾¾ Ask questions that will give you insight into the person’s οο Motives for coaching οο Knowledge of the sport οο Knowledge of how to work with young people οο Character and emotional stability 3.	 Reference check ¾¾ Call at least two references for all candidates you select for further consideration ¾¾ Ask specific questions about aspects of the person’s qualifications you are concerned about 4.	 Short list ¾¾ After conducting the interview and calling the references, compile a short list with all the possible candidates your club has selected. ¾¾ Call those candidates on the short list for a final interview 5.	 Final selection ¾¾ The coaching committee convenes to make the final selection decisions ¾¾ Those selected to be coaches should be contacted to be notified of their appointments ¾¾ Write a courteous letter to those candidates who did not make the selection notifying them they did not qualify.

Supervision and evaluation of coaches

Managers understand well the importance of evaluating team and player performances, but they also must understand the importance of evaluating club coaches. The performance evaluation can enable the supervisor to recognize the coach’s accomplishments and offer suggestions for improvement. If you have quite a lot of coaches in your club, you can hardly supervise and evaluate them all by yourself. You need to have enough qualified individuals to help you supervise and evaluate. In this section, guidelines and steps to help develop a supervision plan, evaluation process, and reward systems will be discussed. 7.4.1	 Guidelines when developing a supervision and evaluating plan ¾¾ Supervise and evaluate all coaches, not just some of them ¾¾ Supervise as much as possible in the given time ¾¾ Supervise and evaluate during training sessions and contests ¾¾ Supervise and evaluate throughout the season ¾¾ Evaluate coaches unannounced ¾¾ When evaluating them, look at weaknesses and strengths ¾¾ Provide feedback to coaches as soon after the evaluation as possible

Guidelines to keep in mind when developing your plan are as follows:

Evaluation process

The evaluation process involves the supervisor completing an evaluation instrument on the coach, and the coach conducting a self-evaluation using the same instrument. The supervisor and coach then meet to discuss the evaluations form and compare and discuss their responses on the form. The criteria for evaluation can include a number of topics and questions and can be directly related to the coach’s responsibilities. See form 7.3 for an example of an evaluation form for coaches.

Reward systems

It is important for a club to develop a structured rewards system for its coaches. This system should offer both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards that meet the psychological, life, and financial needs of the coaches. Intrinsic rewards ¾¾ They are tied to the job design ¾¾ Example: an assistant coach promoted to head coach of the team ¾¾ New position has more responsibility and is more challenging Extrinsic rewards ¾¾ Can come in financial and nonfinancial forms ¾¾ Financial include direct compensation, merit pay, and bonuses that are stipulated in a contract ¾¾ Nonfinancial include social awards, office location, parking sport, car allowance etc. Ideas for recognizing coaches in the club ¾¾ Cover the coaches’ cost of a coaching workshop he wants to attend ¾¾ Give them awards such as emblems, hats, jackets etc. ¾¾ Recognize all coaches who complete certain levels of coaching with awards ¾¾ Publicize the coaches’ names in appropriate sources, such as local newspaper, notice board at the club ¾¾ Recognize assistant coaches who coach well by promoting them to head coaches ¾¾ Recognize head coaches who coach well by asking them to become members of the coaching committee Take the time to organize a good rewards system and you’ll find that you have many more coaches returning next season.

They must also engage with and answer to parents, who come with their own expectations and desire to be involved. Some parents want to be highly involved, others wish to be minimally involved, and a number can become overly involved. Given the central role of parents in a sport club, coaches and sport managers must be prepared to deal with parents on a regular basis and to respond to their needs. In this chapter we will discuss the development of a shared understanding with parents, parent responsibilities, responsibilities of the club towards the parents, and parent problems.

Developing a shared understanding with parents

A shared understanding is: “a multidimensional process that begins with self-reflection and ends with commitment to building relationships with parents that extend beyond the coaching context” A club can develop a shared understanding with parents by means of the following ways: ¾¾ Being transparent about the club’s philosophy ¾¾ Engaging in appropriate and ongoing communication ¾¾ Providing social opportunities 8.2.1	 Transparency about a club’s philosophy ¾¾ The club’s philosophy statement should articulate what the club values and believes ¾¾ It should be openly discussed with the parents ¾¾ It helps parents fully understand what they can expect from the club 8.2.2	 Engaging in appropriate and ongoing communication

The following aspects regarding a club’s philosophy is important to know:

Appropriate and ongoing communication can be achieved to the extent that parents are kept fully informed about all aspects of their children’s experiences. The following strategies can be followed for appropriate and ongoing communication:

3.	 Parents’ forum ¾¾ A parents’ forum is an organization run by parents that helps the club by shouldering some of the administrative responsibilities of the team ¾¾ Parents involved in the forum must be self-directed ¾¾ They schedule their own meetings 4.	 Regular parent information meetings ¾¾ Parent information meetings can be scheduled two or three times during the season ¾¾ These meetings provide an opportunity to revisit the team goals and to answer any questions. ¾¾ These meetings can prevent a barrage of individual meetings 5.	 End-of-season meeting ¾¾ During this meeting the club can find out what the parents liked or didn’t like about the season ¾¾ Parents are also asked to provide suggestions for improvement ¾¾ An anonymous parent questionnaire can be distributed at this meeting to get important feedback. 8.2.3	 Providing social opportunities

Clubs should encourage coaches to build relationships with parents outside of the coaching context. During practices and games coaches have very little time to socialize informally with parents and therefore miss important opportunities to get to know them and understand the athletes within the context of their families. Additional opportunities for social interactions must therefore be planned and can be in the form of a braai at the clubhouse, go bowling etc.

Parent and sport club managers’ responsibilities

Parents of the participants and sport club managers have certain responsibilities in a sport club. These responsibilities will be discussed in this next section. 8.3.1	 Parent responsibilities to the child ¾¾ find out what their children want from their sport and from them in respect to their sport participation ¾¾ provide a supportive atmosphere conducive to their children’s participation ¾¾ determine when their children are ready to begin playing sports ¾¾ ensure that the conditions for playing are safe ¾¾ protect their children form abusive coaches ¾¾ help their children develop realistic expectations of their capabilities in sports ¾¾ help their children interpret the experiences associated with competitive sports

Parent problems

Just as some coaches as problem coaches, some parents are likely to be problem parents. In some clubs parents have become such detriments that sport club managers have banned them from competitions. Banning parents from observing their children’s games is a desperate last-resort solution and a sign that adults have lost perspective about the purpose of the child’s sports. The problems with parents should be classified as minor and major when considering to address them. Minor parent problems ¾¾ parents getting in verbal arguments with coaches, officials, and other parents ¾¾ parents coaching their children or other children from the sideline during a contest ¾¾ parents yelling criticism to players or coaches of either team from the spectators area How to handle minor parental problems ¾¾ after the first incident or two the coach should meet the parent to explain that his behavior is not acceptable and describe clearly what behavior is expected ¾¾ after the next incident, the coach should request that the club manager speak with the parent about the problem, conveying the same information as the coach did ¾¾ if there is another incident the coach and manager should advise the parent that this is the last warning, and should submit a brief written report to the office ¾¾ if the parent further misbehaves it will be recommended that the parent be banned from practices and games for the rest of the season. Major parent problems ¾¾ parents being repeatedly verbally abusive and disrupting the contest ¾¾ any type of physical abuse ¾¾ being out of control because of drinking alcohol or using other drugs ¾¾ cheating on eligibility rules or by using illegal equipment Handling major problem parents ¾¾ all major problems should be reported to the club’s office in writing by the coach ¾¾ if the parent’s behavior directly violates the clubs rules, the penalties as specified by your policies should be immediately enforced ¾¾ if the problem is physical abuse, the severity of the behavior will determine your course of action, varying from calling the police to barring the parent from attending practices and games to meeting with the parent to discuss the problem Parents are vital to the success of the programs at your club and as sport club manager you must have a plan for involving them constructively in your club.

9.1	Introduction
Finances are the nuts and bolts of running a sport club. You need money to run a sport club and therefore you need to budget for your expenses, live within your means, and keep records to account for it all. The purpose of this chapter is to teach you to administer your club’s finance as easy as possible. Aspects that will be discussed in this chapter are sources of funds, budgeting, and accounting.

9.2	

Sources of funds

For clubs to obtain more money for the club, they need to identify certain sources of funds. The two funding sources often underutilized are special-event fundraising and commercial sponsorships. 9.2.1	 Special-event fundraising

Special-event fundraising is distinguished from other sources of funds in that you provide people with a product or service for which they are willing to pay. Numerous ways can be used to raise funds through special events that are both fun and profitable. Examples of special-event fundraisers ¾¾ food sales ¾¾ service sales – car washes, cleanup work, ¾¾ auctions ¾¾ raffles and lotteries ¾¾ social events – parties and dances ¾¾ celebrity sports contests – golf day Requirements for conducting a successful fundraising event ¾¾ your club must have a good image in the community ¾¾ plan an event that appeals to large numbers of people ¾¾ organize the event effectively ¾¾ promote the event well ¾¾ select the appropriate time for the event (not when other events take place) ¾¾ avoid events where you have expenses upfront that risk a potential loss ¾¾ have the support and help of the members of the club to conduct the event

Commercial sponsorships

Sponsorships are business agreements. A business is willing to pay you for the opportunity to communicate a message by being associated with your club. Fundamentally, you are selling a way for the company to communicate a message with an audience that you reach. Benefits for a company to sponsor your team ¾¾ enhanced corporate awareness through association with your club or event ¾¾ building or reinforcing a corporate image ¾¾ opportunity to develop new markets by exposure of a product ¾¾ opportunity to promote sales of a product ¾¾ a means to build and enhance community relations ¾¾ opportunity to compete favorably with competitors in the community Sponsorship is an attractive means to communicate with potential customers. Your club’s programs are seen as contributing to society, and by sponsoring these programs a company may also be seen as contributing to society. Developing a sponsorship plan to obtain a sponsorship There are five steps in the process to obtain a sponsor.

9.3	Budgeting
Budgeting financial resources is a process that a club’s leaders ask club managers to accomplish. Budgeting is an administrative activity required in any size of club, whether an emerging or competitive sport club. The bigger the club, the more complex budgeting will become. Whatever the case, budgeting is an effective method of control and evaluation.
Definition: Budgeting “a management plan estimating anticipated income and expenses for a period of time” 

Goals to accomplish when constructing a budget

When formulating and executing a sport club’s budget the sport club manager should seek to accomplish five basic goals, namely: ¾¾ Understand the budget structure οο You need to have a firm understanding of what funds are going in and out of the club ¾¾ Explain the budget to all stakeholders οο There should be no secrets and all information should be freely shared with administrators, coaches and members of the club on a regular basis ¾¾ Modify the budget when necessary to meet new challenges οο The budget should be flexible enough to meet new needs and demands as they arise without compromising the integrity of the process ¾¾ Sell the budget to all parties ¾¾ Document all phases of the budget process οο Accurate documentation is a matter of absolute trust that must be garnered through exhaustive measures to ensure a complete paper trail at all times.

Elements of a budget

Sport club managers needs to develop an operational budget that details various expenses expected in operating a club. Basic elements within such a budget include the following: 1.	 Fixed costs ¾¾ A cost that will not fluctuate over the course of a budgetary cycle ¾¾ Example οο Rent or mortgage on a property οο Insurance premiums οο Salaries οο Contracted services like lawn care service, trash removal 2.	 Variable costs ¾¾ A cost that will fluctuate based on usage over the course of a budgetary cycle ¾¾ Example οο Utilities such as water and electricity οο Equipment and uniform οο Office supplies οο Travel expenses οο Maintenance οο Tournaments οο Affiliation fees

3.	 Capital expenditures ¾¾ Major one-time purchases that are outside the normal operating expenses ¾¾ Example οο A scrum machine οο Electronic score board οο Flood lights 9.3.4	 Types of budgets

Budgets are typically classified as zero based, fixed, programed, performance and capital budgets. 1.	 Zero-based budgets ¾¾ A zero-based budget is an administrative method that requires the sport club manager and coaching staff to annually negotiate all funding based on documented need. ¾¾ The negotiation starts at zero and is expanded depending on current need in each area of the club. ¾¾ Past history is usually not taken into consideration ¾¾ It requires sport club managers to evaluate each sub function of the club and rank it according to how important it is

¾¾ Areas that become part of such negotiation might include the following:  The number of coaching staff for the upcoming season  All inventory levels and projected needs for the sport  Travel to all competitions  Cost of officials for all home events  Repair, maintenance, cleaning, and replacement of all items in inventory  Repair and maintenance of facilities ¾¾ Purpose of this budget is to control over budgeting and waste 2.	 Fixed budgets ¾¾ Fixed budgeting is an appropriate process for sport clubs in financially stable environments ¾¾ This method requires sport club managers to project both expenditures and income on a month-by-month basis to determine total costs and revenues for the year ¾¾ This type of budgeting is most appropriate for large, well established clubs during periods of relatively economic certainty ¾¾ School sport clubs rarely use fixed budgeting because most of these clubs are not income oriented. 3.	 Program budgets ¾¾ The program budget separates a club by unique units ¾¾ Each sport in the club would develop a separate budget with a description of the sport’s goals and those features of its program that are deemed to be the most important ¾¾ The sport club manager then compare the various budget requests and make decisions based on their needs οο Example, in a school setup, the manager or coach of each sport presented in the school should compile a budget with a description of their goals and most important needs. They hand it in to the school’s sport manager who would make decisions accordingly. 4.	 Performance budgets ¾¾ The performance budget breaks the functions of a sport club into discrete activities and appropriates the funds necessary to accomplish these activities ¾¾ The purpose of this budget is to explain what services and activities are being provided by the club ¾¾ Each activity is defined by the amount of time that is involved to perform the activity and a cost is then attributed to each activity

¾¾ Example, activities with their expenses in a sport club can be  League matches •	 Travel expenses •	 Uniform •	 administration  Tours and Tournaments •	 Uniform •	 Travel expenses •	 Tournament levies •	 Equipment  Coaching •	 Salaries of coaches •	 Administration 5.	 Capital budgets ¾¾ A capital budget describes expenses that include long-range budget items ¾¾ It usually covers a number of years – as many as 10 years ¾¾ It includes major purchases, such as new buildings and equipment (electronic score boards) ¾¾ Capital budgets require a narrative explanation or justification for each expense 9.3.5	 The budget process

Before you begin with the budget process you need to do some budget preparation beforehand. To prepare a financial budget, sport club managers should: ¾¾ Collect past budgets, up to 5 years, to prepare for analysis of expected costs; ¾¾ Collect the statements from the past year for all expenditures and analyze areas of expected increase; ¾¾ Inform all staff of required date for budgetary needs for their specialty areas, i.e. maintenance, facilities etc. for the next budget year; ¾¾ Divide the club’s budget into operating and capital activities; ¾¾ Prioritize budget requests according to necessity; ¾¾ Prepare your budget carefully with all justifications included It is important to follow a systematic process when it comes to reviewing a budget. The following 9 steps are a comprehensive approach to the budget process.

Financial statements

At the most basic level, accounting deals with debits and credits. Debits are the revenues generated. People owing your club money are called debtors, for example an organization who rents your facility for an event. Credits are the expenses that have been budgeted for and must be paid. People your club owes money to are called creditors, for example the municipality you owe water and electricity to. The financial statements discussed in this section are the balance sheet and the income statement. These statements provide an overview of the club’s financial condition in the short and long term. Income statement The purpose of the income statement is to analyze the success of the club. The profit or loss of the club is found in the income statement.
Definition of an income statement: “A statement showing the money a club made and spent over a period of time” 

An income statement is read from the top down with the revenues stated first with a gross profit followed by the operating expenses. Examples of revenues of a sport club can be member’s registration fee, sponsorships, facility rental to outside groups, fund raising etc. The operating expenses include all other expenses a business accrues during day-to-day operations. Examples of operating expenses of a sport club include salaries, insurance, office expenses, contracted services, awards etc. Net income or net profit is the amount of money remaining after all expenses have been paid. This amount is shown in the balance sheet under equity. If the business accrues a net loss, the amount of the loss will be shown in parentheses, (R50 000) represents a R50 000 loss. Sample income state for a sport club Revenue 	Members registrations				R640 000 	Sponsorship					R300 000 	Facility rental					R100 000 	Fund raising					R 60 000 Gross profit						R1 100 000

Definition of a balance sheet  a statement of the financial position of the club that presents the club’s assets and liabilities and how much equity “ the club has at a fixed point in time”

Elements of a balance sheet 1.	 Assets ¾¾ Assets are items that the club owns ¾¾ Assets come in two forms οο Current assets  Cash on hand and any asset that can be converted to cash within a year, for example inventory, prepaid expenses etc. οο Fixed assets  Those items a club owns that cannot be sold without changing the club’s operation  Example facility, equipment, furniture, cars etc. 2.	 Liabilities ¾¾ Liabilities are the financial obligations the club has to other entities ¾¾ It is the club’s debt, how much money the club owes to other parties ¾¾ Example loans from banks

¾¾ Liabilities come in two forms: οο Current liabilities  Are those debts that must be repaid within one year  Example, goods and services purchased on credit usually payable within 30 days, interest, taxes, οο Long-term liabilities  All loans a club may have that are not currently payable  Usually larger loans that were acquired to purchase fixed assets such as a building, car, furniture etc. 3.	 Equity ¾¾ Owner’s equity is the amount of money invested by the owners ¾¾ In a sole proprietorship, the business begins with the amount of money the owner invested from personal funds ¾¾ In a partnership, it is the amount of money each partner invested individually ¾¾ Earned income, as shown in the income statement, is added to the owner’s investment Once the total liabilities and the total equity are calculated, these two figures are added together and the combined values should equal the total assets.

Risk Management

10	 Risk Management
10.1	Introduction
Every sport is risky and as a responsible sport manager you want to provide safe and equitable programs in your club. Athletes, coaches, officials, managers, spectators, and even innocent bystanders can be injured by balls, slippery ground, ill-fitting equipment, lightning, and many other hazards. You’ll need to think about ways to manage risks in your club and the best way is to have a comprehensive risk-management program, which will be discussed in this chapter.

10.2	

What is risk and risk management

Before we define what risk management is, we need to look at what risk is.
Risk: “Risk refers to the probability of loss, either to people’s well-being or to their property”

As a sport manager you will want to manage risk for three groups: 1.	 The participants in your club 2.	 Your coaches, officials, spectators, yourself and your staff 3.	 Your club

Risk Management

Risk management:  the process of decision making and implementation so as to minimize injuries and loss and their effects on your “ sport club, facility, or event”

Reasons for developing a risk management program are: ¾¾ To provide the safest and fairest environment possible for the participants ¾¾ To reduce the risk of liability ¾¾ To prevent losses of all kinds, (financial, physical, property, activity, time) for everyone associated with an organization, including its directors, administrators, employees, spectators, and clients.

Risk management process

To make risk management easier, the risk management process is broken down into four steps that should be taken:

Identify the risks of the sport in your club

Identifying the loss exposures in a particular sport club means determining which exposures will undermine the club’s goals. Essentially, loss exposures can be placed in four categories, namely: ¾¾ Property loss ¾¾ Liability loss ¾¾ Personnel loss ¾¾ Net income loss Property loss Property loss exposure arises out of the possibility of damage, destruction, or disappearance of property resulting from a peril or cause of loss. Examples of losses would be: ¾¾ Unimproved land ¾¾ Buildings ¾¾ Tangible personal property οο Money οο Inventory οο Computer and media equipment οο Valuable records and papers οο Furniture οο Supplies οο Mobile property ¾¾ Intangible personal property οο Patents οο Trademarks οο Copyrights οο Goodwill οο Trade secrets ¾¾ Legal interests in property οο Owner’s interest οο Buyer’s and seller’s interest οο Landlord or tenant’s interest

Liability loss Liability loss exposures results from a club having a legal responsibility to pay a claim for bodily injury or property damage sustained by another party. These loss exposures arise out of: ¾¾ Torts οο Negligence οο Intentional torts οο Strict liability torts ¾¾ Contracts οο Breach of contract ¾¾ Statutes οο Such as workers compensation Personnel loss A personnel loss exposure occurs when an employee, manager, or owner with special knowledge or skill retires, resigns, or dies.

Risk Management

Net income loss Net income loss arises when some circumstance affecting the club causes reduction of net income, which could occur as a result of property, liability, or personnel loss exposures. This could happen in poor economic times when revenues are down. Reduction of loss exposures cannot be accomplished if they are not identified. Sometimes identification of loss exposures is simple and obvious, but even those circumstances lead to a multitude of lawsuits. For each loss exposure described above, a club’s risk management team will have to make a complete assessment. 10.3.2	 Evaluate and analyze the risks

Once risks have been identified, those risks should be analyzed. A common means of analysis is the risk matrixes that analyze risk exposures based on severity vs frequency. Such charts provide guidance for classifying risks as severe, moderate or slight in severity, as well as slight, moderate, or definite as to frequency. In situations in which loss severity is slight to significant and loss frequency is slight to moderate, it may be reasonable to take actions to reduce or prevent the losses from occurring. For example, at your sport club’s facility, slips and falls are common occurrences that vary in severity. These may deserve more risk management attention than the possibility of a large fire, and the club would likely put more resources into slip and fall reduction and prevention. 10.3.3	 Examine possible risk control techniques

Risk control techniques include the following: ¾¾ Avoidance technique οο This means a club decides to stop a particular activity or not start it in the first place οο Example, a primary school decides not to present tackle rugby for boys under the age of 12, but only tag rugby. ¾¾ Loss prevention techniques οο This technique implements measures to reduce the frequency of loss οο Example, the club may prohibit any spectators at a hockey match to stand behind the goal boxes, to decrease the number of spectators hit by hockey balls. ¾¾ Loss reduction technique οο Loss reduction is a loss control technique that is designed to decrease loss severity οο Example, rugby players wearing padding, they may still injure themselves when being tackled, but this protection will reduce the severity of injuries.

¾¾ Duplication οο Duplication means having spare parts or equipment so you can continue business as usual if a loss occurs. ¾¾ Separation οο Separation means dispersing assets or activities so that if, for example, a natural disaster occurs, it will not wipe out all of the club’s assets or activities 10.3.4	 Implement risk control techniques

After identifying risks in your club, assessing them, and examined possible risk control techniques, you now need to implement those techniques. Someone has to take charge in implementing the techniques, and this could be the coach, club manager, or owner. The person in charge puts safety first – above winning or profits. For example, lightning is imminent and only 15 minutes of the rugby game remains. The score is tied, and the spectators are excited. The sport club manager has to make a decision to stop the match or to risk playing on with the potential lightning, which has been known to strike the rugby club before.

Implementing loss prevention and reduction techniques The following are means of implementing loss prevention and reduction techniques: ¾¾ Facility inspection οο Inspections can take place at regular intervals, such as daily or weekly, or they can take place before, during, and after practices or events οο Example, before a rugby game or practice begins; the field should be inspected for holes, dangerous objects, or defects. οο Documentation of each inspection is important in the event a lawsuit is filed ¾¾ Facility cleaning, maintenance, and repair οο Each area of the facility should have a documented cleaning and maintenance schedule οο Regular inspections should reveal additional cleaning, repair, and maintenance οο The facility should be monitored at all times for slipping and tripping hazards οο Maintenance should take place on a regularly scheduled basis οο Repairs should be made promptly οο If an item is found to be in disrepair, it should be taken out of service immediately οο If it cannot be stored, a sign should be displayed warning that it is out of service and should not be used ¾¾ Crowd management οο If your club hosts events in which large crowds gather, an important part of risk control is establishing and implementing a crowd management plan οο The following elements should be present in a crowd management plan:  Competent staff trained in crowd management  Emergency and disaster planning and implementation  Procedures to eject unruly, intoxicated, or disruptive spectators  Use of signage to promote crowd management ¾¾ Protective gear οο A sport club may wish to require and enforce use of certain protective gear as part of its implementation of loss prevention and reduction techniques οο The use of mouth guards, shin guards, helmets, and protective padding will reduce the frequency of injuries and their severity

¾¾ Equipment οο Equipment should be regularly inspected and tested to determine if it is still working properly οο Maintenance should be done regularly as appropriate to all equipment οο After each use, equipment should be cleaned in accordance to the manufacturer’s recommendations οο When using equipment, the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding use, maintenance, and repair should be followed οο Documentation of cleaning, repair, and maintenance of equipment is important if a lawsuit ever arises over equipment that causes injury

How to make the activities at your club safer

There are five things you can do to make the activities in your club safer. 1.	 Develop a risk-management plan ¾¾ Develop policies and procedures to help reduce injuries in the specific situation ¾¾ Example, compile a policy stating that boys younger than 12 years may not play against boys older than 16 years. 2.	 Keep knowledgeable about current standards ¾¾ Standards are continually evolving, so you need to stay abreast of any changes ¾¾ Pass on the appropriate information to your staff and coaches 3.	 Educate your staff and coaches ¾¾ Pass along to your staff and coaches the information they need to implement your risk-management plan and to fulfill their duties ¾¾ Help your staff understand that part of their responsibility is to be ongoing risk managers ¾¾ You need to have regular sessions, written policies and guidelines and periodic training for emergency procedures 4.	 Supervise your program ¾¾ Supervision is essential to see that your staff and coaches carry out the program in a safe way ¾¾ As sport club manager you usually will have general supervisory duties over all areas of the club ¾¾ You will often need to assign others to provide general and specific supervision ¾¾ When you assign others to supervise a playing facility or special event, they must be competent to: οο plan for the activity οο present clear warnings of risks οο provide age- and gender-appropriate supervision οο know how to provide for a safe environment οο be able to evaluate injuries οο implement an emergency plan 5.	 Keep records ¾¾ In the event of an alleged wrongdoing, without records it becomes your word against the accuser’s

Managing specific risks

No matter how much you try to prevent accidents, they are going to happen and injuries result. Your duties are to do all that you can to minimize accidents and injuries and keep your organization from being held liable for accidents and injuries. To achieve these objectives, you need a medical response plan. Medical response plan The following elements should be considered when preparing your medical response plan: ¾¾ All participants should provide you with medical histories οο This information can be obtained when they become a member of the club ¾¾ Obtain a consent form for participation οο Children should not be allowed to participate until they have submitted a consent form ¾¾ Have all participants fill out an emergency information card οο This information card should include the names and numbers of parents or guardians to contact in the event of an emergency οο This card should also contain information to alert you to any preexisting medical conditions the participant may have that could influence the treatment ¾¾ Train your coaches and supervisors about what to do and what not to do when players are injured οο Ideally, every coach should be qualified to administer CPR and first aid ¾¾ There should be a first-aid kit at every practice and contest οο coaches should know how and when to use it ¾¾ Develop an emergency plan to obtain medical assistance fast οο If there are no phones at the playing site, arrange to have cellular phones available at practices and games ¾¾ Keep good records of the accidents

11	 Event Management
11.1	Introduction
Every event is a product, an outcome, and an occurrence. An event occurs in a specific year and month, on a specific date, and at a specific place. All preparations must be completed before the event begins. Managing an event is planning the tasks to be done and seeing that they are completed. Planning an event is deciding in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who will do it. The components involved in the planning of an event depend on the nature of the event, the time, place and the clientele. In this chapter a sport event planner will be discussed in detail to guide you in managing an event.

11.2	

Sport event planner

Starting an event takes major commitment of time and energy. A sport club manager must be aware of the different aspects to organise and manage before, during and after an event. A sport event planner is a detailed document compiled with all the aspects to take in consideration when organising an event. The sport event planner includes planning the event objectives, financial planning, accommodation plans, promotion plans, facilities planning, rules and official plans, risk and emergency plans, registration plans, scheduling plans, staffing plans, equipment planning, awards plans, food service plans, communication plans, transportation plans, and an event evaluation plan. 11.2.1	 Event objectives ¾¾ Determine for whom the event is planned οο Is it an amateur or professional event? οο For what age group is it? οο Is it for boys, girls, men or women? ¾¾ Determine the type of event οο The event could be league play over a season or it can be a tournament, a match or something else οο Describe in detail exactly the type of event you will hold ¾¾ Determine the size or scope of the event οο To help determine facility and equipment needs, personnel requirements, accommodation requirements and the budget, you need to set some limits on how many participants or teams your event will involve οο Set criteria as to how the limit will be reached, such as first come first served, or past participation in the event etc.

Each event should have its own objectives and can be compiled by following these guidelines:

¾¾ Determine the dates and duration of the event by considering the following: οο Number of days needed to complete all competition while allowing participants adequate rest between contests οο Number, availability, cost and size of facilities οο Convenience of the dates for participants, coaches, officials, and other personnel οο Availability of officials and other personnel to conduct the event οο Competing events and holidays οο Probability of delays, cancellations, rain-outs, and conflicting events ¾¾ Determine the location of the event οο The event may be at your club’s facilities that you control οο The event may require multiple sites to complete all the contests ¾¾ Determine if the event will be profitable for your club ¾¾ One of the main objectives of hosting an event should be to make a profit for your club. 11.2.2	 Financial planning

The first issue your club needs to deal with when thinking through the creation process is, does your club have the resources to devote to this project without it generating any income for your club? If your club can’t afford the time at the front end of the event, then you should not go this route. One of the key financial issues is whether your club has the capital to start an event.

Accommodation plans

Planning for accommodation becomes necessary when teams travel out of town and participate in events lasting more than one day. For the event your club is hosting, you need to consider whether to use a hotel, university or school dormitory, guesthouses, or private housing. The following should be considered when planning the accommodation: ¾¾ Determine need and cost for participants, officials, and others οο Decide for whom and how many housing is needed οο Make the necessary appointments with the different places that can offer accommodation, and set a price with them οο The availability of accommodation will determine how big the event can be, if there is not much accommodation available then you can only host a couple of teams. ¾¾ Decide on what type of accommodation you are going to make use of οο Hotel – more expensive and will increase the event costs, but is a good option for senior players who can afford such accommodation οο University or school dormitory – best option for events where you need to accommodate a lot of participants οο Guesthouses – good option for accommodating the officials of the event there οο Private housing – ideal for events where only one team traveling needs to be accommodated οο At all times you need to keep safety and expense in mind ¾¾ Arrange for the accommodations οο Make written reservations at the specific places the participants will be staying οο Obtain addresses and telephone numbers of the places they will be staying οο Make sure all agreements for the accommodation such as price, meals, washing, parking etc. is stated in the written reservation οο Make sure to inform the places of the final total of people staying there at least 3 weeks before the event, so they can make the necessary arrangements accordingly 11.2.4	 Promotion plan

Promotion is the way you let your target audience know about the event and encourage them to participate. Guidelines for developing your promotion plan are as follows: ¾¾ Determine what you want to promote and to whom οο Promote the event to school sport managers and coaches οο Promote the event to sport club managers and coaches οο Promote the event to the public who you hope will come and watch the event οο Promote the event to potential sponsors

Scheduling plans involves scheduling the contests for participants and can include such duties as compiling fixtures (round-robin, pool-system), setting dates, times and places for the contests. During your facility planning (10.2.5) you’ve already booked the facilities you are going to need for the event, so you now need to draw a schedule (fixtures) of who is playing where and on what day at what time. Example: For your u/16 hockey tournament you have 2 fields available and 8 teams that entered (4 boy’s teams and 4 girl’s teams). The tournament takes place over 2 days. The first day is play-offs and the second day is finals.

Conducting the event

Good planning is vital for a successful event, but now you must see to it that your plans are carried out. First, you will find that not everything was planned as perfectly as you thought, and you will have to respond to problems, even crises, as they arise. Your most important role as event manager is to provide leadership, directing and moving the team forward. You need to control events by monitoring and supervising others to be sure plans are carried out. Prepare yourself to solve problems and crises as they arise, for instance you may run into inclement weather, throwing off your entire schedule; you may encounter facility or equipment problems; you may need to resolve a dispute or conflict among people, and almost certainly communications will break down here and there and the situation will need your attention. As you provide the leadership and supervision required, don’t lose sight of the fact that the event should be fun for the players, coaches, parents, spectators, and you.
