Problem 1

Problem 1
Bryan Singler is evaluating results for three separate business segments under his control. Selected financial information for each segment follows:
Operating Income $	 250,000 1,125,000 400,000 $	 Average Assets 3,750,000 10,800,000 7,980,000

Sales Segment A Segment B Segment C $	 3,600,000 6,300,000 2,880,000

Rank order the three segments based on ‚Äúmargin,‚Äù ‚Äúturnover,‚Äù and ‚Äúreturn on investment.‚Äù How is it possible that the rankings differ based on which evaluative model is used?

Worksheet 1
Sales Segment A Segment B Segment C $	 3,600,000 6,300,000 2,880,000 $	 Operating Income 250,000 1,125,000 400,000 $	 Average Assets 3,750,000 10,800,000 7,980,000

Margin (operating income √∑ sales) Segment A Segment B Segment C

Turnover (sales √∑ average assets) Segment A Segment B Segment C

ROI (operating income √∑ average assets) Segment A Segment B Segment C

Solution 1
Sales Segment A Segment B Segment C $	 3,600,000 6,300,000 2,880,000 $	 Operating Income 250,000 1,125,000 400,000 $	 Average Assets 3,750,000 10,800,000 7,980,000

Margin (operating income √∑ sales) Segment A 0.0694 3rd Segment B 0.1786 1st Segment C 0.1389 2nd

Turnover (sales √∑ average assets) Segment A 0.9600 1st Segment B 0.5833 2nd Segment C 0.3609 3rd

ROI (operating income √∑ average assets) Segment A 0.0667 2nd Segment B 0.1042 1st Segment C 0.0501 3rd

This problem illustrates the importance of comprehensive analysis. For example, the company with the best turnover also has the worst margin and second best ROI. Depending on the variable of focus, the manager could achieve different rankings of the various segments.

Problem 2

Problem 2
University Inn‚Äôs most recent monthly expense analysis report revealed significant cost overruns. The manager was asked to explain the deviations. Below is the ‚Äúbudget v. actual‚Äù expense report for the month in question.
University Inn Budget v. Actual Expense Report For the Month Ending October 31, 20X8 Actual Utilities Laundry Food service Rent/taxes Staff wages Management salaries Water Maintenance $	 $	 81,800 32,890 63,000 100,800 88,700 70,000 24,024 28,090 489,304 $	 $	 Budget 72,000 28,800 56,000 100,800 85,000 72,000 16,000 24,000 454,600 $	 $	 Variance (9,800) (4,090) (7,000) ‚Äì (3,700) 2,000 (8,024) (4,090) (34,704)

The Inn has observed that utilities, water, food service, staff wages, and laundry costs all vary with activity. The other costs are fixed. The budget reflected above was based upon an assumed 80% occupancy rate. The university‚Äôs football team was on a winning streak and numerous alumni were returning to campus in October, resulting in a 92% occupancy rate during the month. Prepare a ‚Äú‚Äùflexible budget‚Äù‚Äù based upon a 92% occupancy rate, and identify whether the Inn is being efficienctly or inefficiently run. Comment on specific costs, and note why a flexible budget can improve performance evaluations.

* These variable costs are 115% (92/80) of the amounts included in the static budget.

With the exception of water usage and maintenance costs, each category reflects better-than-budgeted financial performance. The flexible budget reveals that most of the ‚Äúcost overruns‚Äù are attributable to increases in costs due to increases in volume. The manager should probably be congratulated for cost control rather than criticized for cost overruns.

Problem 3
Head Stone produces granite grave stones. These monuments are etched with the name of the deceased and other information. Each monument typically requires 300 pounds of granite. The standard cost for granite is estimated at $150 per ton (2,000 pounds). During a recent month, 200 monuments were constructed. The company purchased and used 25 tons of material at a cost of $175 per ton. Compute the total variance for materials, and determine how much is related to price and how much is related to quantity.

Problem 4
Parent Golf produces handmade golf clubs. The process is labor intensive. The speed at which a club can be built depends on the skill level of the individual worker. Management has established a standard of 4 labor hours per club. The standard wage rate is $11 per hour. During a recent month, 1,500 custom clubs were produced. Management was pleased that only 5,100 labor hours were worked, however total wages amounted to $81,600. Compute the total variance for labor, and determine how much is related to rate and efficiency components.

Problem 5
At the beginning of the year, Fort Worth Manufacturing estimated that its annual variable factory overhead would be $923,400, and its fixed factory overhead would be $1,798,200. The company‚Äôs payroll consisted of 27 direct labor employees, and each was expected to work 1,800 direct labor hours. Fort Worth applies overhead to products based on direct labor hours. Each finished unit produced by the company is anticipated to require four direct labor hours. Actual production and cost information for the year is as follows: Total units produced		 Actual variable overhead	 Actual fixed overhead	 12,000

$	 910,000 $	 1,750,000 45,500

Actual labor hours		

a)	 Compute the variable overhead variances. b)	 Compute the fixed overhead variances.

Exercise House manufactures and sells a home exercise kit. The kit is sold via 30-minute televised commercials that run on periodic Saturdays. Below are typical results for a Saturday campaign, assuming 3,750 units were actually sold. However, volume has been known to fluctuate from 3,000 to 4,500 units. Prepare a flexible budget scenario, assuming volumes of 3,000, 3,500, 4,000 and 4,500 units. If Exercise House wants to at least cover costs at volumes of 3,500 units and above, what is the minimum selling price per kit?

The variable expenses per unit are determined by dividing the given total variable costs by 3,750 units (e.g., $138,750/3,750 = $37 per unit for the kit, etc.) The per unit values are multiplied times the various outcomes (e.g., $37 per kit √ó 3,000 kits = $111,000, etc.). The unit selling price would need to be at least $102.07 to breakeven at 3,500 units ($357,250/3,500 units).
