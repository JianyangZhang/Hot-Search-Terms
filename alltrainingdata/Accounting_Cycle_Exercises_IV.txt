Problem 1
Alberto Condor has an eye for quality. He recently formed an art gallery where he allows artists to display their artwork for sale. Customers buy the artwork through the gallery, but payments are actually made payable directly to the originating artist. Artists, in turn, pay Albert a 20% commission that is appropriately reflected as revenue of the gallery. Following is Albertâ€™s trial balance after the first year of operation. This trial balance does not reflect the adjustments that are necessary, as described by the additional infomation.
ALBERT CONDOR ART GALLERY Trial Balance As of December 31, 20X8 Debits Cash Supplies Display equipment Loan Payable Capital Stock Revenues Rent Expense Salaries Expense Interest Expense Utilities Expense $	64,400 23,765 52,500 38,500 84,000 1,750 18,900 $	283,815 Credits $	26,250 87,500 170,065 $	283,815

The Display equipment was purchased near the beginning of the year. It has a 5-year life and no salvage value. Its cost should be depreciated equally over its life. Albert is entitled to receive $62,650 of commissions for art sold. This revenue has not yet been recorded, but it is fully expected that the artists will soon be making payment. Supplies on hand at year end were counted, and amount to $11,900.

Wolfgang Schnitzer is in charge of financial management for Over-Head-Eye Corp. Over-Head-Eye utilizes satellite technology and sophisticated mapping software to alert its customers to trespassing, illegal dumping, and other encroachments on property these customers own around the globe.

Working Capital:
Current assets Less: Current liabilities R 2,517,550 932,750 R 1,584,800

Current Ratio: Current assets Ã· Current liabilities		 Quick Ratio: Quick assets Ã· Current liabilities		 R 2,201,500 Ã· R 932,750 = 2.36 R 2,517,550 Ã· R 932,750 = 2.70

The ratios do not seem to indicate a liquidity problem. Current assets are almost 3Ã— current liabilities, and a large portion of those assets are in highly liquid items such as cash and receivables.

d)	 It is true that the adjustments produce no change in net income. The increase in revenues of $37,500 is exactly offset by the increase in expenses ($12,000 + $4,500 + $11,700 + $9,300 = $37,500). However, the individual accounts would not be correct if the adjustments were not made. It is important that all information be correct, and the adjustments should be recorded.
