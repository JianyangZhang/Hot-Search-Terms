Problem 1

Problem 1
Max Protect Armored Cars, a private-sector company, provided the following aggregated data for armored construction jobs during a recent period: Direct materials	 Direct labor	 Applied (and actual) factory overhead	 Beginning work in process	 Ending work in process	 $ 4,480,923 7,296,518 2,741,151 4,850,032 5,853,000

a)	 How much is cost of goods manufactured? Is this necessarily the same as cost of goods sold? Why or why not?

Worksheet 1
a)	

Solution 1
a)	
Direct materials Direct labor Factory overhead Total manufacturing costs Add: Beginning work in process inventory Less: Ending work in process Cost of goods manufactured $	4,480,923 7,296,518 2,741,151 $	14,518,592 4,850,032 $	19,368,624 5,853,000 $	13,515,624

Cost of goods manufactured is not necessarily the same as cost of goods sold. The cost of goods manufactured is transferred to finished goods inventory. Cost of goods sold is calculated by adding cost of goods manufactured to beginning finished goods inventory, and then subtracting the ending finished goods inventory.

Problem 2
The Print Shop produces custom paintings. Costs are tracked for each painting, with shop overhead being applied at 125% of direct labor cost. Print Shop began July with one job in process. This job had beginning work in process which included total costs of $6,500 (direct labor, direct material, and applied overhead). During July, four new jobs were begun. These consisted of the Smith family portrait, the Wilde family reunion portrait, the county courthouse painting, and the Waterson baby painting. The only job remaining in process at the end of July was the Wilde family portrait. To date, $8,000 in direct labor and $2,500 of direct materials had been committed to the Wilde job. Total direct labor incurred on all jobs during July was $21,900. Total direct material incurred on all jobs during June was $6,900. a)	 Compute the ending work in process inventory balance and the total cost assigned to finished jobs. b)	 Why is it necessary to track costs to individual jobs? c)	 The overhead application rate is based on estimates. What happens if the amount of overhead applied to individual jobs differs from the amount of overhead actually incurred?

Solution 2
a)	 The ending work in process is $18,625 ($8,000 + $2,500 + ($8,000 × 125%)).
Direct materials Direct labor Factory overhead (applied) Total manufacturing costs Add: Beginning work in process inventory Less: Ending work in process Cost of goods manufactured $	6,900 21,900 27,375 $	56,175 6,500 $	62,675 20,500 $	42,175

The finished jobs are assigned a total cost of $42,175. b)	 Photo Shop may use the costing data to establish fair pricing for each job. In any event, it would be important to know if specific jobs are profitable or not, and monitor job performance and efficiency. Costing data are important in providing managerial insight over these and related issues. c)	 If more overhead is applied than actually incurred, or vice versa, the difference is frequently credited or charged to cost of goods sold. If the deviation is large, it is a signal that the application rate may be faulty.

Problem 4
Information for three different companies follows. Each company applies factory overhead at the rate of 20% of direct labor cost. In each scenario, the following entry was made to record the actual overhead costs:
Factory Overhead Salaries Payable Utilities Payable Supplies Accumulated Depreciation 53,125 31,250 9,375 2,500 10,000

Prepare a compound journal entry for each company to transfer raw materials to production, record direct labor costs on each job, and apply overhead at the predetermined rate. If the scenario involves underapplied or overapplied overhead, prepare an additional journal entry to transfer the amount to Cost of Goods Sold.

Problem 6
Canadian Adventure recently acquired Deep Alaska Air. Deep Alaska has been in business for many years, and provides charter flights for remote fishing and camping enthusiasts. When the company originally started into business, aircraft, insurance, and fuel were relatively inexpensive. Pilot salaries was by far the most significant cost factor, and has continued to be used as the basis for allocating overhead. Heretofore, the company has classified all costs, other than pilot salaries, as overhead. The company prices trips to customers at 150% of “cost.” Canadian is concerned about the appropriateness of the costing/pricing technique and has engaged you to study this issue, with a goal of improving Deep Alaska’s overall operations.

Problem 6

Aggregated data for the most recent year are:
Pilot salaries* Aircraft depreciation (6,000 engine hours) Insurance (fixed annual cost) Fuel ($11 per gallon) Other costs
* Includes amounts paid for “wait time” that varies considerably by trip.

$	

350,000 935,000 400,000 990,000 125,000

Sample data from three specific recent flights is as follows:
Flight A Pilot Salaries Engine hours on flight Fuel used $350 3 60 gals. Flight B $615 1 20 gals. Flight C $400 9 180 gals.

a)	 Using the existing scheme, determine the overhead application rate and price for Flights A, B, and C. b)	 Is “job” costing appropriate for a “nonmanufacturing” business like Deep Alaska? c)	 Evaluate the merits of the overhead allocation scheme in use by the company. d)	 Using engine hours to allocate overhead, and classifying pilot salaries as direct labor and fuel as a direct materials cost, prepare a revised pricing schedule for the three flights (continue to assume that flights are priced at 150% of cost). e)	 If pricing is revised as described in part (d), what is the likely result on profits?

Managerial and Cost Accounting Exercises III

Problem 6

Solution 6
a)	 Costs are applied at $7.00 per $1.00 of pilot salaries. This is calculated by dividing the total non-salary costs of $2,450,000 ( $935,000 + $400,000 + $990,000 + $125,000) by the pilot salaries of $350,000. As a result, Flights A, B and C are priced as follows:
Flight A Pilot salaries Allocated cost Total cost Pricing factor of 150% Price for flight $	 $	 $	 350 2,450 2,800 X 1.50 4,200 $	 $	 $	 Flight B 615 4,305 4,920 X 1.50 7,380 $	 $	 $	 Flight C 400 2,800 3,200 X 1.50 4,800

b)	 Increasingly, businesses are applying “job” costing concepts to track, monitor, and price services. The concepts are as applicable to service businesses as they are to product manufacturing environments. c)	 The costing method of Deep Alaska appears deficient. Fuel appears to be a direct material cost at about 20 gallons per engine hour. Likewise, depreciation is also associated with engine hours. Thus, given that these two largest cost factors are allocated based on labor dollars, there is seemingly a disconnect between costs and their drivers. d)	 Costs are applied at $243.33 per engine hour. This is calculated by dividing the total nonsalary and non-fuel costs of $1,460,000 ($935,000 + $400,000 + $125,000) by the engine hours (6,000). As a result, Flights A, B and C are priced as follows:
Flight A Pilot salaries Fuel cost ($11 per gallon) Allocated cost ($243.33 per hour) Total cost Pricing factor of 150% Price for flight $	 $	 $	 350 660 730 1,740 X 1.50 2,610 $	 $	 Flight B 615 220 243 $	1,078 X 1.50 1,617 $	 $	 Flight C 400 1,980 2,190 4,570 X 1.50 $	6,855

e)	 The prices of individual flights will be altered considerably but overall profits will not be impacted. The total of all costs will be recovered, plus the 50% markup. This would be true under either approach. However, a quick review of the above data suggests a serious disconnect between the cost of services and their true pricing. Market forces would like cause a loss of customers for the overpriced flights and excess demand for the underpriced flights. This will limit profitable growth. If the company does not adjust its costing/ pricing mechanism, it should at least try to eliminate unprofitable flights and sell as many “overpriced” flights as possible. Point out that most businesses must consider complex variables in pricing, and that cost data are only one facet.

Problem 7
Oregon Conference Tables processes timber into large conference table tops. Production occurs in two phases – sawing and sanding. The sawing phase is almost entirely automated and costs are largely driven by processing time on a computerized sawing machine. Sanding is a labor intensive process, and the amount of time on a particular job varies considerably based on the intrinsic stone quality and the desired sheen for a particular job. The Sawing Department applies factory overhead based on sawing machine hours. The Sanding Department applies factory overhead based on direct labor hours. The following table reveals estimates for the upcoming year. These estimates were used to determine the applicable factory overhead application rates:
Sawing Direct labor Direct materials Factory overhead Direct labor hours Sawing machine hours $	 $	 $	 500,000 300,000 1,100,000 40,000 110,000 $	 $	 $	 Sanding 3,200,000 24,000 720,000 200,000 n/a

Problem 7

During the year, the company received and processed a table top order for a Fortune 500 company. The following table reveals information extracted from the materials requisition forms and daily time sheets relating to this particular job:
Sawing Direct labor Direct materials Direct labor hours Sawing hours $	 $	 900 555 72 189 $	 $	 Sanding 5,310 60 210 n/a

Looking back at the end of the year, the company determined that actual data were as follows:
Sawing Direct labor Direct materials Factory overhead Direct labor hours Sawing machine hours $	 $	 423,500 $256,900 1,015,000 33,600 96,233 $	 $	 Sanding 2,807,000 $28,000 658,000 211,750 n/a

a)	 Determine the factory overhead application rates for each department. b)	 Compute the cost to be assigned to the Fortune job. The job had been bid to the customer at a sales price of $65 per square foot, and the final dimensions are 5 feet by 30 feet. Did the company make a profit on this job? c)	 Determine if overhead was underapplied or overapplied, and reassess the profit on the Fortune job.

Managerial and Cost Accounting Exercises III

Problem 7

Solution 7
a)	 Factory overhead would be applied at $10.00 per sawing machine hour in the sawing department ($1,100,000/110,000 hours). Factory overhead would be applied at $3.60 per direct labor hour in the sanding department ($720,000/200,000 hours). b)	
Sawing Direct labor Direct materials Factory overhead (189 X $10.00) Factory overhead (210 X $3.60) $	 $	 $	 $	 $	 900 555 1,890 3,345 $	 $	 $	 $	 $	 Sanding 5,310 60 756 6,126 $	 $	 $	 $	 $	 Total 6,210 615 1,890 756 9,471

The job was bid at $9,750 ($65 per square foot × 6ʹ × 30ʹ), and had a cost of $9,471. The job’s price barely recovered the direct cost of production. However, be sure to note that selling, general, and administrative costs would not be included in these production costs! c)	
Sawing Actual factory overhead Direct labor hours Sawing machine hours Applied overhead rate Applied overhead Underapplied overhead $	 $	 $	 44,500 10.00 445,000 570,000 $	 $	 $	 3.60 762,300 (104,300) $	 $	 1,207,300 465,700 $	 1,015,000 $	 Sanding 658,000 $	 Total 1,673,000

The factory overhead was underapplied by $465,700, and this unfavorable condition would be allocated to cost of goods sold. The “extra” cost was not taken into consideration in part (b), so the margin on the Fortune job is even less than first calculated. Reapplying the actual factory overhead based on the actual hours yields a revised cost of $9,471:
Sawing Direct labor Direct materials Factory overhead (189 X $10.55*) Factory overhead (210 X $3.11**) $	 $	 $	 $	 $	 * $1,015,000/96,233 hours = $10.547 * $658,000/211,750 hours = $3.11 900 555 1,993 3,448 $	 $	 $	 $	 $	 Sanding 5,310 60 653 6,023 $	 $	 $	 $	 $	 Total 6,210 615 1,993 653 9,471
