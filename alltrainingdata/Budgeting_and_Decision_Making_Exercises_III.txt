Problem 1

Problem 1
Carpet Clean manufactures a chemical carpet cleaner. The company was formed during the current year. As a result, there was no beginning inventory. Management is evaluating performance and inventory management issues, and desires to know both net income and ending inventory under generally accepted accounting principles (absorption costing) as well as variable costing methods. Relevant facts are as follows:
Selling price per gallon Variable manufacturing cost per gallon Variable SG&A costs per gallon Fixed manufacturing costs Fixed SG&A Total gallons produced Total gallons sold $	11.00 2.00 2.25 $	2,900,000 470,000 1,625,000 1,500,000

Problem 1

Solution 1
Absorption Costing Variable manufacturing costs ($2 X 1,625,000) Fixed manufacturing costs Cost of goods manufactured Cost of goods sold ($6,150,000 X (1,500,000/1,625,000)) Ending inventory ($6,150,000 X (125,000/1,625,000)) Sales (1,500,000 X $11) Cost of goods sold Gross profit Selling, general, & administrative costs Variable (1,500,000 X $2.25) Fixed Net income Variable Costing Ending inventory ($2 X 125,000) Sales (1,500,000 X $11) Variable manufacturing costs ($2 X 1,625,000) Variable manufacturing margin Variable SG&A (1,500,000 X $2.25) Contribution margin Fixed expenses Manufacturing SG&A Net income $	2,900,000 470,000 $	 3,370,000 6,505,000 $	250,000 $	16,500,000 3,250,000 $	13,250,000 3,375,000 $	9,875,000 $	3,375,000 470,000 3,845,000 $	6,978,077 $	3,250,000 2,900,000 $	6,150,000 5,676,923 $	473,077 $	16,500,000 5,676,923 $	10,823,077

Note that the difference in income between the two methods, for this first year of operation, is also the difference in ending inventory. Also discuss why income is positive under absorption costing and negative under variable costing.

Problem 2

Problem 2
FairWay Golf Carts manufacturers and sells a golf carts. The carts usually sell for $8,000 per unit. The company normally sells units as quickly as manufactured and does not maintain a finished goods inventory. However, during the most recent year, the company produced 21,000 units, but only sold 19,000. A foreign customer has requested to buy the other 2,000 units for delivery on December 31 of the year current year. The offered price is $6,125 per unit for all 2,000 units. Below are absorptioncosting based calculations of ending inventory and net income, based on the 19,000 units already sold.
Variable manufacturing costs ($5,250 X 21,000) Fixed manufacturing costs Cost of goods manufactured Cost of goods sold ($146,250,000 X (19,000/21,000)) Ending inventory ($146,250,000 X (2,000/21,000)) Sales (19,000 X $8,000) Cost of goods sold Gross profit Selling, general, & administrative costs Variable (19,000 X $150) Fixed Net income $	2,850,000 9,800,000 12,650,000 $	2,504,762 $	110,250,000 41,000,000 $	151,250,000 136,845,238 $	14,404,762 $	152,000,000 136,845,238 $	15,154,762

Prepare a revised absorption-costing based income statement, assuming acceptance of the 2,000 unit order. Also prepare variable-costing income statements (with and without the order). Compare the results and evaluate whether the order should be accepted.

Absorption Costing Sales (19,000 X $8,000) + (2,000 X $6,125) Cost of goods sold Gross profit Selling, general, & administrative costs Variable (21,000 X $150) Fixed Net income Variable Costing (19,000 units) Sales (19,000 X $8,000) Variable manufacturing costs (19,000 X $5,250) Variable manufacturing margin Variable SG&A (19,000 X $150) Contribution margin Fixed expenses Manufacturing SG&A Net income Variable Costing (21,000 units) Sales (19,000 X $8,000) + (2,000 X $6,125) Variable manufacturing costs (21,000 X $5,250) Variable manufacturing margin Variable SG&A (21,000 X $150) Contribution margin Fixed expenses Manufacturing SG&A Net income $	41,000,000 9,800,000 50,800,000 $	50,000 $	164,250,000 110,250,000 $	54,000,000 3,150,000 $	50,850,000 $	41,000,000 9,800,000 50,800,000 $	(1,400,000) $	152,000,000 99,750,000 $	52,250,000 2,850,000 $	49,400,000 $	3,150,000 9,800,000 12,950,000 $	50,000 $	164,250,000 151,250,000 $	13,000,000

Under absorption costing, net income decreases by accepting the special order. The company’s profit decreases from $2,504,762 to $50,000. Under variable costing, the company goes from a loss of $1,400,000 to a profit of $50,000. Note that the profit is the same under both methods when there is not beginning or ending inventory. The essential difference is that fixed manufacturing overhead is all charged to expense under variable costing, but is partially carried as an asset in inventory under absorption costing. There is no single right answer as to whether the order should be accepted. The key point is to think critically about cost allocations, and how they can influence the decision-making logic that should be applied.

Problem 3

Problem 3
The Grain Company started many years ago producing a single product. Over the years it has grown to produce many diverse consumer products ranging from foods to paper goods. Currently, the corporation is barely making a profit and the price of its stock has languished. Division managers have traditionally been incentivized with stock options and awards. However, management is evaluating a new bonus plan based on segment profits within each division. Below are 20X7 facts about the Wheat Products Division, which generates 15% of overall corporate revenue. The Wheat Products Division has two key products – whole wheat and white flour. Total sales of whole wheat and white flour	 Traceable, controllable, Wheat Products Division fixed costs	 Traceable, uncontrollable, Wheat Products Division fixed costs	 Non-traceable, controllable, Wheat Products Division fixed costs	 Non-traceable, uncontrollable, Wheat Products Division fixed costs	 Variable selling, general, & administrative costs	 Variable product costs	 General corporate expenses for all divisions	 $11,437,500 2,562,500 1,800,000 375,000 875,000 2,262,500 5,425,000 2,000,000

Problem 3

Prepare a contribution income statement for the aggregateged Wheat Products Division fixed costs (one column). If the division manager is to be evaluated on controllable contribution margin, would the Wheat Products Division fixed costs manager appeared to be entitled to a bonus?

Worksheet 3
20X7 Divisional Report for Wheat Products Contribution Income Statement Sales Less: $	11,437,500

Solution 3
20X7 Divisional Report for Wheat Products Contribution Income Statement Sales Less: Variable product costs Variable selling, general, and administrative costs Total variable costs Contribution margin Less: Controllable fixed costs ($2,562,500 + $375,000) Controllable contribution margin Less: Uncontrollable fixed costs ($1,800,000 + $875,000) Segment margin 5,425,000 2,262,500 $	7,687,500 3,750,000 2,937,500 $	812,500 2,675,000 $	(1,862,500) $	11,437,500

If the manager is evaluated on controllable contribution margin, then a profit is evident. However, great care must be taken in this evaluation as there are other costs that are incurred in the operation. The total segment margin is negative, and this number does not yet include consideration of general corporate expenses.

Problem 5

Problem 5
Lewis Custom Manufacturing produces kitchen cabinets in a two-step production process – cutting and sanding. The manufacturing center is supported by two service centers – a health clinic and a janitorial service. The following table reveals certain facts about each activity:
Cutting Department 15 36,000 $2,800,000 Sanding Department 20 24,000 $3,200,000

Health Clinic Employees Square footage Cost incurred 3 3,600 $720,000

Janitorial Service 6 1,800 $500,000

a)	 Using the direct method, allocate the service department costs to production. The clinic costs are to be allocated based on employees, and the janitorial costs are to be allocated based on the square footage. b)	 Using the step method, allocate the service department costs to production. The clinic costs are to be allocated based on employees, and the janitorial costs are to be allocated based on the square footage. The first step will be to allocate clinic costs. The clinic employees maintain their space and do not rely upon the janitorial service. However, janitorial employees occasionally sustain an injury and utilize the clinic.

Problem 6
Sonic produces hair dryers. Each unit sells for $75. During 20X7, the company produced 55,000 units, and sold 48,000 units. Beginning inventory contained a total of 4,000 units. Production and SG&A costs have been stable for many years. Assume the per units costs in beginning and ending inventory are identical. Per unit cost information follows: Direct materials cost	 Direct labor cost	 Variable factory overhead	 Variable SG&A	 18.75 12.50 15.00 6.25

Annual fixed manufacturing overhead is $220,000. Annual fixed SG&A totals $250,000. a)	 Determine the number of units in ending inventory, and calculate the total carrying cost using both variable and absorption costing. b)	 Calculate 20X7 net income using variable costing. c)	 Calculate 20X7 net income using absorption costing.

Problem 6

Solution 6
a)	 Ending inventory contained 11,000 units. Simply, inventory increased by 7,000 units (55,000 produced – 48,000 sold). The beginning inventory of 4,000 units, plus the 7,000 unit increase, yields an ending inventory of 11,000 units. Under variable costing, the ending inventory would contain only the variable manufacturing costs ($18.75 + $12.50 + $15.00 = $46.25 per unit). 11,000 units × $46.25 = $508,750 ending inventory. Under absorption costing, the ending inventory would contain the variable manufacturing costs ($46.25 per unit) plus allocated fixed manufacturing overhead ($220,000/55,000 units = $4 per unit). 11,000 units × ($46.25 + $4) = $552,750 ending inventory. b)

Problem 7
Kitchen Appliances Store has three major departments: Dishwashers, Ovens, and Refrigerators. The appliance department has been a consistent money loser, as typified by the following recent monthly operating report:
Total Sales Variable expenses Contribution margin Fixed expenses Income (loss) $	6,630,000 5,460,000 $	1,170,000 793,000 $	377,000 Dishwashers $	1,950,000 1,560,000 $	390,000 260,000 $	130,000 Ovens $	3,120,000 2,600,000 $	520,000 208,000 $	312,000 Refrigerators $	1,560,000 1,300,000 $	260,000 325,000 $	(65,000)

Management is considering a strategy to exit the refrigerator business. If this strategy is followed, the floor space currently dedicated to refrigerator will be used to expand the dishwasher showroom space. It is believed that dishwasher sales will increase by 20%.

Problem 7

Fixed expenses that can be avoided by abandoning refrigerator sales include the salary of a service tech and the elimination of a delivery van. The two components total $25,000 per month. The remaining fixed costs relate to facilities expenses and employees that will be diverted to dishwasher sales activities. Evaluate the impact on total profitability of exiting dishwasher sales. How can overall profits be negatively impacted by abandoning an “unprofitable” product line?

Worksheet 7
Total Sales Variable expenses Contribution margin Fixed expenses Income (loss) $	– $	– $	Dishwashers $	– $	– $	Ovens $	– $	– $	Refrigerators $	– $	– $	-

Solution 7
Below is a revision of the monthly operating report to reflect the elimination of refrigerators. Dishwasher sales and variable expenses are each increased by 20%. $300,000 of the refrigerator unit’s fixed costs are transferred to dishwashers.
Total Sales Variable expenses Contribution margin Fixed expenses Income (loss) $	5,460,000 4,472,000 $	988,000 768,000 $	220,000 Dishwashers $	2,340,000 1,872,000 $	468,000 560,000 $	(92,000) Ovens $	3,120,000 2,600,000 $	520,000 208,000 $	312,000 Refrigerators $	– $	– $	-

Note that eliminating refrigerator sales results in a decrease in overall profitability. Fixed costs of $300,000 continue, and the additional margin from selling more dishwashers is not sufficient to offset the loss of contribution margin that was being generated from refrigerators. This results in a net loss in the dishwashwer segment. Great care is needed to make good decisions about eliminating product lines.
