Excel 2010 Introduction: Part I

Introduction

Section 1	 Introduction
Excel 2010 is a powerful spreadsheet application that allows users to produce tables containing calculations and graphs. These can range from simple formulae through to complex functions and mathematical models. All graphics related to Microsoft in this book is in compliance with Microsoft guidelines and thus permitted by Microsoft.

How To Use This Guide
This manual should be used as a point of reference following attendance of the introductory level Excel 2010 training course. It covers all the topics taught and aims to act as a support aid for any tasks carried out by the user after the course. The manual is divided into sections, each section covering an aspect of the introductory course. The table of contents lists the page numbers of each section and the table of figures indicates the pages containing tables and diagrams.

Objectives
Sections begin with a list of objectives each with its own check box so that you can mark off those topics that you are familiar with following the training.

Instructions
Those who have already used a spreadsheet before may not need to read explanations on what each command does, but would rather skip straight to the instructions to find out how to do it. Look out for the arrowicon which precedes a list of instructions.

Appendices
The Appendices list the Ribbons mentioned within the manual with a breakdown of their functions and tables of shortcut keys. Keyboard Keys are referred to throughout the manual in the following way: ENTER‚Äì Denotes the return or enter key, DELETE ‚Äì denotes the Delete key and so on. Where a command requires two keys to be pressed, the manual displays this as follows: CTRL + [P] ‚Äì this means press the letter ‚Äúp‚Äù while holding down the Control key. Commands When a command is referred to in the manual, the following distinctions have been made: When Ribbon commands are referred to, the manual will refer you to the Ribbon ‚Äì

Excel 2010 Introduction: Part I

The Basics

Windows Concepts
Excel is an application that runs under the Windows graphical user interface. When launched, Excel sits in its own ‚Äúwindow‚Äù ‚Äì the box that surrounds the application elements. The window can be moved, sized, closed, minimised and maximised using the features common to the Windows environment ‚Äì these are listed below: Window BorderThe box that surrounds the Excel screen when it is not maximised is called the window border. When the mouse is over the border, the pointer changes from a single to a double-headed arrow ‚Äì clicking and dragging with this shape allows the window to be resized. Title barThe coloured bar that appears at the top of the Excel window. The title bar tells you which application you are using and if the workbook you are in is maximised, it will also contain the name of the workbook. If the Excel window is not maximised, by positioning the mouse over the title bar and clicking and dragging, you can move the Excel window to a new location on the screen.

Maximise buttonWhen working in a workbook, the Excel screen contains two windows, an application window and a workbook window. You can maximise both windows to capitalise on the space you have on-screen. If you would like the window that your Excel application is in to fill up the whole screen, click the outermost maximise button. You may find that the workbook you are in can still be bigger ‚Äì click the inner maximise button to fill the remaining space within the Excel application window.

Minimise buttonThis button is very useful if you need to temporarily switch from Excel into another application without closing Excel down completely. Click the minimise button to shrink Excel to an icon on the task bar; you will then be able to view other icons and applications you may wish to access. When you are finished and ready to continue, click the Excel icon from the task bar to resume. The innermost minimise button will minimise the current workbook window.

Restore buttonThis button only appears when a window is maximised. A maximised window has no border and you cannot see what is behind it. If you want to put the window back inside its border so that you can move and size it, click the restore button.

Close buttonThis button is used to close a window. If you click the close button for a workbook window you close the document. The last button will close the Excel application.

Dialog Box Launcher this button launches dialog boxes specific to the part of the ribbon you see them the category will be named such as font, clipboardetc.

Menus
Menu‚Äôs are no longer used in Excel they have been replaced by Ribbons and will be referred to as such throughout the manual.

Ribbons
Ribbons are tabs that show different commands with respect to what you wish to do.

The home ribbon shows basic commands of formatting. The Insert ribbon allows the insertion of any object. Just click on the named ribbon to see list of commands that you can perform by clicking on the appropriate icon. By holding your mouse over an icon, a helpful hint will appear to show you what that command will do. Clicking will apply that command. Any Icon on the ribbon with a down arrow offers other options and sometimes a dialog box such as the down arrow on the table button. Any option within the menu that has a series of dots after it will usually display a dialog box.

The Basics

Dialog Box
Within each tab, the available icons are seperated into diffierent ‚ÄòGroups‚Äô. The name of the group is shown under the icons, at the bottom of the ribbon e.g. Font, Paragraph etc. To the right of the Group name you may see a small icon with an arrow in it . This is the Dialogue Box launcher and allows you to launch/view the dialogue box associated with that group ‚Äì simply click on the relevant dialogue box launcher.

When the dialog box is open, make a choice from the various options and click ok at the bottom of the dialog box. If you wish to change your mind and close the dialog box without making a choice then click on cancel. The dialog box will close without any choice being applied. If you would like help while the dialog box is open then click on the ‚Äú?‚Äúin the top right hand corner. This will bring up a help window that will display the relevant topics. Many dialog boxes may be more familiar if you have used EXCEL before.

File Ribbon
The File Ribbonis the key ribbon within excel and has many important commands and options. Such as excel settings, opening, saving, printing and closing files. This will be looked into much further later in the manual.

The Basics

Quick Access Toolbar
By default there are only three buttons on the quick access toolbar but these can be edited and other regularly used buttons can be placed there. Using the drop down menu nest to the quick access toolbar will allow the customisation of this toolbar adding your most often used commands.

Mini Toolbar
Whenever text is selected within excel a small formatting toolbar will appear above the highlighted text it will disappear if the mouse cursor is moved away from the toolbar and will reappear when the mouse cursor is moved over the highlighted text again.

Name Box
The name box is the small white box to the left of the formula bar as we will discover later has a number of useful features such as navigation, the creation and selection of named cells and ranges. Entering a cell reference and pressing return will navigate you to the specific cell entered. Using the drop down arrow to the right of it will allow you to select any specified names in the workbook. When creating functions the box will have a different appearance and will allow you to choose the most popular functions used in that workbook.

Formula Bar
The formula bar is the white bar to the right of the name box and is used for entering and editing data. Creating and editing functions and formulae. The construction of Formulae and functions can be seen in this bar even when the cell containing the formula is showing a calculated value. (Unless cell is formatted to hidden and the sheet protected). The fx button on the left of the bar is a tool to create functions and formulae

Status Bar

The Status bar, across the bottom of the screen, displays different information at different times. To the left is an indicator, which will display Ready, Edit etc. depending on the mode in which the user is currently working. If menus are being accessed, this area will usually give details on the currently highlighted menu option. If you are in the middle of a task ‚Äì copying data for example ‚Äì this area will often display messages and prompts instructing you on what to do next.

To the Left on the Status bar, keyboard status indicators reveal whether the Num Lock etc. are switched on.

Task Pane

A task pane is a window that collects commonly used actions in one place. The task pane enables you to quickly create or modify a file, perform a search, or view the clipboard. It is a Web-style area that you can either, dock along the right or left edge of the window or float anywhere on the screen. It displays information, commands and controls for choosing options. Like links on a Web page, the commands on a task pane are highlighted in blue text, they are underlined when you move the mouse pointer over them, and you run them with a single click. A task pane is displayed automatically when you perform certain tasks, for example when you choose Insert, Ribbon and thenclipart to insert a picture

Smart Tags
Smart Tags, first introduced in Microsoft Office XP, make it easier for you to complete some of the most common tasks and provide you with more control over automatic features.

You do not have to complete any additional steps to make the Smart Tags appear or disappear in Excel. The Paste Options, AutoFill Options, Trace Error and Insert smart tags appear automatically to allow you to quickly choose actions and remain in place until you begin another action. For example, when you complete a paste operation, the Paste Options button remains in place alongside your text until you begin typing new text. This feature alerts you via a smart Tag of a possible error in a cell. You can select a command to resolve the error, ignore it, or access further Error Checking options. The example above right shows the use of a smart tag where a formula has been written into a cell with a possible error i.e. =Sum (A1:A2) may need to read =Sum (A1:A3). If you hover over the tag, the message, the formula in this cell refers to a range that has additional numbers adjacent to it, appears then the options drop down.

Getting Help
Excel offers several quick ways to get help when performing particular tasks. You can select from a list of topics provided by Help, or you can even type a help request in plain English, and Excel will supply the answer using the Answer Wizard.

Data Entry
Enter Text And Numbers
There are various aspects to note and be aware of, both in terms of entering data, and also to do with the nature of the data being entered. You can enter data into a cell by positioning the cursor in the cell and typing the information. The maximum number of characters that a cell can contain is 32,000. Excel recognises text and numeric entries and initially displays them with different alignments ‚Äì left for text and right for numbers. You can override these with other formats if required.

Move Around and Enter Data

1.	 Move to the cell where you want the entry and type a word (for example NAME in cell A1). The text will appear in the Formula bar as well as in the current cell. The cursor will be visible as a flashing insertion point in the formula bar.

2.	 Click on the green tick mark on the formula bar to confirm the entry. Or Keyboard 1.	 Press ENTER to confirm the entry. ‚Ä¢	 Until you confirm an entry, Excel remains in ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù mode, and the cell is active (see Status bar). Excel will return to the ‚ÄúReady‚Äù mode, and the text will appear in the cell. ‚Ä¢	 When you press ENTER to confirm an entry, Excel will by default move the selected cell down to the cell below. You can disable this setting or choose to move the selected cell in a different direction using the excel options dialog box (File Ribbon). See the Customisation section for more information.

Cancelling And Editing Data Entries
You may find that you have typed an entry into the wrong cell. Provided you have not confirmed the entry by pressing ENTER or clicking the green tick from the formula bar, you can abandon it. To Abandon Or Cancel An Entry: Mouse

1.	 Click the red cross from the Formula Bar. OR

Use the BACKSPACE to delete characters behind the cursor or DELETE to delete characters in front of the cursor within the data or you may add information to the entry before confirming it.

Enter Dates
It is possible to enter dates into Excel and have them accepted and displayed as such provided you use a recognised format. Excel 2003 will allow entry of dates from 1900 onward. Recognised Formats For Dates ‚Ä¢	 Use a forward slash (/) as the day/month/year separator:01/01/01 ‚Ä¢	 Use a dash (hyphen) as the day-month-year separator:1-1-01 ‚Ä¢	 Do not use full stops as a date separator as excel will read this as text and the value will not be entered as a true date Dates entered in excel appear as dates but are actually numbers formatted to appear as dates this allows calculation with them so it is important to enter them correctly. A date once entered correctly will ALWAYS have a four digit year in the formula bar however that date may appear in the cell. Dates start at the number 1 which represents the date 1-1-1900. Dates being numbers align to the right. Any date entered before that date will not be recognised as a true date to excel but will be seen as text and therefore align to the left as with all text. If you omit the year from a date, Excel will assume the current year. You will not see the year in the cell but if you look at the cell contents on the Formula bar, you will see that Excel has added it. With some recognised date styles, Excel will automatically format the date to display in a certain way. You can choose how your dates are displayed by formatting them yourself (see the section on formats for more information). ‚Ä¢	 Some entries are recognised by Excel and are formatted automatically. Dates are one such entry (as described above), percentages are another. When you delete data from such cells and replace it with other entries, you may find that you get surprising results. This is because although you cleared the data from the cells, the formats still remain and are causing the new data that you typed to display in a certain way. For more information on clearing cell data, see the clearing cells later in this section.

Autocomplete
When you type the first few letters of an entry into a cell, Excel can complete the entry automatically using an option known as AutoComplete. It does this by building a list based on the entries already entered in a column. If Excel suggests an inappropriate entry, you can pick a different entry from the list.

Editing
There are various ways in which you can change or remove data you have entered in cells on the worksheet.

Typing Replaces Selection
This option is a feature that is standard throughout the Microsoft Office suite. It ensures that if you type when an item is selected, your typing replaces the selected item. This is extremely useful in a number of instances. When you want to change a short cell entry, it might be quicker to make use of this option to overwrite the entry with the new one. To Overwrite A Cell Entry: Keyboard 1.	 Move to the cell you want to change. 2.	 Type in the new entry (the former one will disappear as soon as you start typing). 3.	 Press ENTER to confirm the changed entry.

Use The Mouse To Edit
Perhaps one character has been omitted, or two characters have been transposed, and only a slight adjustment needs to be made. If this is the case, you can add or change characters using edit mode.

Clear Contents, Formats And Comments
If you want to remove an entry completely from a cell, you need to clear the cell. There are a variety of ways you can do this and the method you choose depends on what you want to remove from the cell. You can remove data from cells using the ribbons or the keyboard. This command would only remove cell data (numbers, text, dates, and formulae). If you have formatted the cells, clearing their contents would leave the formats intact so that new data you type in the cleared cells would keep the old data‚Äôs formats. To Clear Contents: w

‚Ä¢	 Novice users occasionally imagine that they can clear a cell simply by replacing its contents with a space. This is a dangerous practice and is to be avoided. Although a cell containing nothing but a space may appear to be empty, Excel remembers that a space has been entered there. Such renegade spaces will take up room both in memory and on disk, and can cause real problems with more advanced spreadsheet and database functions. . Avoid them by clearing cells properly.

Excel 2010 Introduction: Part I

Formulae and Functions

Formulae
In a spreadsheet application, at a very basic level, values often need to be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided. To allow for the fact that individual values might change, spreadsheet formulae generally refer, not to actual values, but to the cells where those values are being held. If values have been entered into A1 and A2, then A1+A2 will return an answer which will automatically recalculate if the value of A1 should change. It is this automatic recalculation which makes spreadsheets invaluable. Excel recognises formulae because they are preceded by an equals sign (=). When entering basic formulae, the mathematical operators defining the operation to be carried out are as follows: Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Exponentiation + * / ^

You will find all of these mathematical operators ranged across the top and down the right hand side of the numeric keypad.

Typing Formulae
You enter formulae by typing them in the cell where you want the formula‚Äôs result to appear. When you confirm entry of a formula, Excel will display the result on the worksheet, but the underlying calculation appears on the Formula bar.

To Enter A Formula: Keyboard 1.	 Move to the cell where you want to enter the formula. 2.	 Type an equals sign (=). 3.	 Type the formula (e.g. d2*e2). 4.	 Press ENTER to confirm the entry.

41

Excel 2010 Introduction: Part I

Formulae and Functions

5.	 Excel automatically recalculates formulae. If you change one of the cells referenced in your formula, as soon as you press ENTER to confirm the changed value, your formula result will update.

Entering Formulae By Pointing
It is possible to enter formulae without actually typing the equals sign (=) or the cell references. Instead, you can make use of a pointing technique to indicate which cells are to be included. As with typing formulae, it is important to start off in the cell where the answer is to be displayed. Pointing can be quicker and more efficient than typing cell references as it reduces the chances of errors. To Enter A Formula Using Keyboard AND Mouse: mouse 1.	 Position the cursor in the cell where you want the formula. 2.	 Type an equals sign (=). 3.	 Click the first cell whose reference should be included in your formula. A moving dotted line, known in Excel as a ‚Äòmarquee‚Äô, will appear around that cell and the cell reference will appear in the formula bar immediately after the equals sign. Or 1.	 Use an arrow key to move there. A moving dotted line, known in Excel as a ‚Äòmarquee‚Äô, will appear around that cell and the cell reference will appear in the formula bar immediately after the equals sign. 2.	 Type in the mathematical symbol you want to use in your calculation, then click on (or move to) the next cell to be included in the formula. 3.	 Continue building the formula in this way. 4.	 Press ENTER to complete the formula.

Errors In Formulae
Sometimes you may get surprising results from a formula. This is most often because you have referenced the wrong cell, but it could also be that you have multiplied where you should have added and so on. You can correct formulae using the editing techniques described earlier in this manual. To Edit A Formula: Mouse 1.	 Double-click on the cell containing the formula. The cell will switch from displaying the result of the formula to the formula itself. 2.	 Click the mouse over the part of the formula to change to anchor the cursor there. Type any new characters or use the BACKSPACE and DELETE keys to remove characters. 3.	 Press ENTERto confirm the changes. Or 1.	 Move to the cell containing the erroneous formula. 2.	 Click on the Formula bar which will show you the formula where you want to make the change. 3.	 Type any new characters or use the BACKSPACE and DELETE keys to remove characters. 4.

Filling Formulae
Having entered an initial formula in the first cell of a column or row, you often find that you want to generate results for the other cells in that column or row. In the example below, you would probably want your formula to work out totals for all the orders. There are a variety of ways that you can get Excel to copy a formula so that it generates results for other cells in a column or row.

Bodmas With Formulae
BoDMAS is a mathematical acronym that simply reminds us of the order of operations that mathematics uses to step through more complicated formulae. (Brackets), (Division), (Multiplication), (Addition), (Subtraction). Excel follows these rules to a point please take note of the following table to see the order of preference that excel uses when working out calculations To change the order of evaluation, enclose in brackets the part of the formula to be calculated first.
1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th % ^ * and / + and ‚Äì & = <> <= >= <> ‚Äì Percent Exponentiation Multiplication and division Addition and subtraction Connects two strings of text (concatenation) Comparison Negation (as in ‚Äì1)

Using Bodmas E.G. The following formula produces 11 because Excel calculates multiplication before addition. The formula multiplies 2 by 3 and then adds 5 to the result. Type = 5+2*3 press ENTER Result =11 In contrast, if you use parentheses to change the syntax, Excel adds 5 and 2 together and then multiplies the result by 3 to produce 21. Type = (5+2)*3 press ENTER result = 21

Basic Functions
Having mastered how to set up your own custom formulae, you will be able to carry out any calculations you wish. However, some calculations are complicated or involve referring to lots of cells making entry tedious and time consuming. For example, you could construct a formula to generate a total at the bottom of a column (or the end of a row), like this: =D2+D3+D4+D5 The above formula would work, but if there were 400 cells to total and not just 4, you would get bored with entering the individual cell references. When formulae become unwieldy or complex, Excel comes to the rescue with its own built-in formulae known as functions.

Functions always follow the same syntax: The name of the selected function tells Excel what you want to do and the arguments generally tell Excel where the data is that you want to calculate. Excel has a huge number of functions, not all of them are relevant to everyone. The functions are categorised according to what they do. In this manual, we outline some of the most basic functions that can be usefully used at a general level.

Excel 2010 displays information about function arguments as you build a new formula. The tool tips also provide a quick path to Help. You click any function or argument name within the tool tip.

Cell References
In functions, you often need to refer to a range of cells. The way Excel displays cell references in functions depends on whether the cells you want the function to act upon are together in a block or in several non-adjacent cells or blocks. The table below explains how you can use different operators to reference cells:
Operator Reference operator: (colon) , (comma) (single space) Description Range operator, which produces one reference to all the cells between two references, including the two references Union operator, which combines multiple references into one reference Intersection operator, which produces one reference to cells common to two references - In this example, cell B7 is common to both ranges Example B5:B15

SUM(B5:B15,D5:D15) SUM(B5:B15 A7:D7)

Absolute and Relative References
Relative References
When you fill formulae, you tell Excel to base the formulae it creates on the one you have entered by starting from the cell that contains it.

In the example shown right, the formula being copied says =D2*E2. However, once copied, if you click on any of the copies, Excel will have updated the references to keep the row numbers current (D3*E3, D4*E4 and so on). This is because Excel, by default, uses relative referencing. When you enter a formula, you enter specific cell references. Behind the scenes, Excel ‚Äòtranslates‚Äô those references into positions relative to the result cell. So, in our example shown left, Excel would take the formula:

58
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

Excel 2010 Introduction: Part I =D2*E2 Translate it as follows: = [two cells to the left]*[one cell to the left].

Formulae and Functions

It therefore does not matter which row you copy the formula into, Excel will always use ‚Äú[two cells to the left] multiplied by [one cell to the left]‚Äù to generate the result. Most of the time, this is what you would want, but there are occasions where you need to stop Excel updating cell references when you copy formulae.

Absolute References
The example below shows a formula being created to work out the amount of discount each order would receive. The order totals are in column F and the discount rate is in B13. The initial formula has therefore been set up as: =F2*B13 The formula will generate a result for the first order. However, when copied, you will get zeros against the discount amounts for the other orders. This is due to the relative referencing that Excel applies to all formulae by default.

Having copied the above formula, if you clicked on any formula in the Discount amount column below the first one, you would see that Excel has updated the references (=F3*B14, F4*B15). This is where the problem lies ‚Äì you want Excel to change the first reference as your formula needs to refer to the different order totals, but the discount rate should remain constant. You need to make that reference absolute.

File Operations

Working with Files
You can save any information entered in Excel so that you may call it back at a later stage either to add, edit or print the contents. It‚Äôs a good idea to save work frequently as this will minimise the risk of work being lost in the event of a power cut or system fault.

Saving Files
Excel gives any new document you create a temporary name ‚Äì the word ‚ÄòBook‚Äô followed by a number. The number increases by one for each new workbook you create in any one work session.

Parts Of The Save As Dialog Box

Previous/next folder- As you move through the folder structure in the Files list, these buttons allow you to go back to a previous folder that you viewed.

At the bottom of the dialog box are two list boxes, one for the file name and one for the document type. Excel automatically assigns the first few words you typed as the workbook name.

File Types And File Names
Excel in general has always saved files with three letter filetype‚Äôs such as book1.xls or accounts.xlt the last three letters always being the type of file that it is saved as. In 2010, however, this has now changed and the default filetype for all excel files is now book1.xlsx a four character filetype. This is because the nature of the contents of the file has changed radically and is in no way comparable to earlier versions. Naming A File: Mouse 1.	 Click in the File name box and drag your mouse over the current file name ‚Äì this will highlight it. Then type the new name. 2.	 Choose from the save as type box which version of excel you wish to save this file as. (If somebody using a previous version needs to access this file this is essential) 3.	 Finally, when the location, name and filetype have been entered, save the workbook by clicking the button marked Save. This closes the dialog box. Back in the Excel screen you will notice that the name you allocated to your workbook appears on the title bar at the top of the screen 4.	 If you saved this file as an earlier version you will see compatibility mode next to the filename in the title bar ‚Ä¢	 Workbook names can be up to 255 characters. File names cannot include any of the following characters: forward slash (/), backslash (\), greater than sign (>), less than sign (<), asterisk (*), period (.), question mark (?), quotation mark (‚Äú), pipe symbol (|), colon (:), or semicolon (;). You do not need to type the document extension (‚Äú.xls‚Äù) as Excel automatically adds this to all files you save.

Moving and Copying Data

Having entered information in a worksheet, you may decide that you need to reposition it or use cell entries in another worksheet or file that you have created. The good thing about Excel is that once you have entered something once, you can move or copy it anywhere ‚Äì to other Excel files and even to files that belong to other applications. All Microsoft products use the same terminology when describing moving and copying items ‚Äì cut, copy and paste. These terms stem from the times when typesetters would lay out templates by physically cutting an item from its current location, and gluing or pasting it in to the new location.

Moving Items
To Move Items: Mouse

1.	 Select the cells that you want to move.

2.	 Click the Cut button on the Home Ribbon. The selected cells will display a marquee around them and Excel will show a prompt on the Status bar to tell you what to do next.

3.	 Move to the cell where you want to place the cells you cut. If you have cut a block of cells, the cell you select before you paste is where you want the top left cell in the cut block to move to. 4.	 Click the Pastebutton from the home ribbon

Insert Paste
As already mentioned, Excel will overwrite existing data with cells that you are moving or copying. There are occasions where you want to swap the positions of cells without overwriting what you already have.

In the example above, if you wanted to move the selected cells up two rows so that both ‚ÄúViking Supplies‚Äù orders were next to each other, you would have to use Insert paste to do it, otherwise the existing data (the ‚ÄúBloggs & Co. order) would be overwritten.

Borders

When you print a worksheet, Excel allows you to choose whether you want all the cell gridlines to print or not. Often, you want to print some but not all of the lines ‚Äì this is when you need to apply borders. You can then tell Excel not to print the gridlines but your borders will be printed. To Apply Borders: Mouse 1.	 Select the area you want to border. 2.	 Click the drop-down list arrow to the right of the Borders button on the Formatting toolbar. 3.	 From the palette, click on the required border option.

If the palette does not have the bordering option that you want to apply, use the Format cells dialog (discussed later in this section) to apply the borders. To Remove Borders: Mouse 1.	 Select the area with the borders you want to remove. 2.	 Click the drop-down list arrow to the right of the Borders button on the Formatting toolbar. 3.	 From the palette, click on the first border option.

Alignment
You can select from three different cell alignment options in Excel by clicking the relevant button (described below). The buttons determine how data lines up between the left and right edges of the selected cell(s).

Excel 2010 Introduction: Part I To Change Alignment: Mouse 1.	 Select the cell(s) whose alignment you want to change. 2.	 Click on the button for the alignment you require (see below).

Formatting

Click this button to left-align cell data. Left alignment ensures that the left edge of an entry is flush with the left edge of the cell. Left alignment is the default alignment for text entries in cells.

Click this button to centre cell data. This will make each cell entry in the selection position itself in the middle of the cell.

Click this button to right-align cell data. Right alignment ensures that the right edge an entry is flush with the right edge of the cell. Right alignment is the default for numeric cell entries.

Merge Cells
If you want to type a heading across the top of a table of data, it can be quite difficult to line it up in the centre. If the columns in your table are different widths, or the title is a certain length, the chances of you getting it exactly central along the top of the table are practically nil. Luckily Excel has a solution. You can merge the cells across which you want the heading, centring it at the same time.

3.	 If you need to take the indent back, click the decrease indent button to do this.

Number Formats
Initially, numbers in Excel use a General format. You may find that the results of formulae run to different numbers of decimal places, or you might want to display numbers as monetary values with a currency symbol and two decimal places. There is no need for you to enter the numbers in the way you want them displayed ‚Äì it is far better to use Excel‚Äôs number formatting buttons.

Formatting

Increase And Decrease Decimal Places
You can add and remove decimal places from numeric data using the Increase Decimal and Decrease Decimal buttons. Where you decrease, Excel will round numbers up or down to the nearest unit. However many places that you may increase or decrease the value to excel will still use the entered value to calculate not the value that appears in the cell as this is only an appearance not a true value (check formula bar) To Increase Decimals: Mouse

1.	 Select the cells with the numbers you want to change. 2.	 Click the Increase Decimal button from the alignment group on the home ribbon 3.	 Keep clicking the Increase Decimal button until your numbers display the correct number of decimal places. To Decrease Decimals: Mouse

1.	 Select the cells with the numbers you want to change.Click the Decrease Decimal button from the alignment group on the home ribbon 2.	 Keep clicking the Decrease Decimal button until your numbers display the correct number of decimal places.

Comma Style
Comma style sets all the selected numbers to 2 decimal places and puts commas between different thousand multiples. e.g. 100000 would become 100,000.00 when comma style is applied to it.

Currency
Applying this style will add a ¬£ sign and two decimal places (pence) to the selected numbers. To Apply Currency Style: Mouse

1.	 Select the cells with the numeric data you want to format.Click the Currency button from the Number group on the home ribbon. 2.	 Using the drop down arrow to the right of the currency button gives access to the most likely used currency formats in use you can choose from different currency symbols using the Format Cells dialog discussed later in this section

Percent Style
Where you have typed decimals on the worksheet, you may want to express those values as percentages. You can do this with the Percent Style format. e.g. 0.5 would become 50% when you apply Percent Style.

Excel 2010 Introduction: Part I To Apply Percent Style: Mouse

Formatting

1.	 Select the cells with the numeric data you want to format.Click the Percent Style button from the Formatting toolbar. ‚Ä¢	 The number formats (apart from Increase and Decrease Decimal) are mutually exclusive. Applying Comma Style to cells that already have Currency formats would lose the currency symbol. If you need to return to the default General style for numbers, you can use the Format Cells dialog discussed later in this section. ‚Ä¢	 If you ever see ###### in cells that normally display numbers, it is because the format you have applied is too wide for the column. To show the numbers, either change to a format that fits or widen the column (see later in this section for details on changing column widths).

Advanced Formats
When you want to apply formats that Excel does not give you buttons for on the Formatting toolbar, you need to use the Format Cells dialog. This dialog contains all the formatting options (including those accessible via the Formatting toolbar) that you can use within the Excel application.

Format Cells Dialog
The Format Cells dialog is divided into tabs, each tab dealing with a format category.

You can use the settings on this tab to control which cells are accessible when you protect a worksheet. This topic is dealt with in the section ‚ÄúWorking with multiple sheets‚Äù later in this manual.

Formatting Columns and Rows
Excel has some formats that apply themselves to whole columns and rows. Changing widths and heights, hiding, inserting and deleting rows and columns are all operations that you might want to carry out.

Column Width
You can alter the width of a single column, or by selecting the columns whose width you want to change, you can make all columns in the selection the same width. With a single column, Excel changes the width of the column to the left of your mouse pointer. To Change Column Width: Mouse

1.	 Move the mouse over the intersection between the column letters on the right-hand side of the column you want to change. The mouse pointer will display the shape that you need for changing column width. 2.	 Click and drag to the right or left to widen or narrow the column ‚Äì a guide will draw itself down into the worksheet to preview where the column edge will jump to, and Excel will display the actual width of the column in points in a tip box that appears. 3.	 Release the mouse when the desired width has been reached. To Change Width Of Multiple Columns: Mouse 1.	 Select the columns whose width you want to change by clicking and dragging over the column letters with the selection pointer (white plus).

All columns on that sheet will change to the new size Any column that has previously had its width changed will be unaffected by this those that have been changed will have to have their width changed manually if you wish all columns to be same width. Because other formats can affect the widths your columns need to be, it is often a good idea to leave changing column widths until last, this will avoid you repeatedly having to change the widths as you apply other formats. If the column of a cell is too narrow to display the numbers, Excel displays the cell with ‚Äò####. If you hover over the cell a tool tip will appear displaying the information within the cell.

Row Height
Excel automatically changes row height when you alter the font and point size of the cell entries within it. However, you can alter the height of a single row manually, or by selecting the rows whose height you want to change, you can make all rows in the selection the same height. With a single row, Excel changes the height of the row above your mouse pointer.
