McEnroe Corporation and Edberg Corporation each sell tennis equipment. McEnroe Corporation‚Äôs strategy is to focus on selling quality units at the best possible prices, while attempting to minimize selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A). Edberg Corporation has concluded that many customers will differentiate more on brand than quality, and is promoting its inferior goods with a significant marketing campaign. Study each company‚Äôs income statement below, and calculate the respective proportion of sales returns, the gross profit margin, and the net profit on sales. Both companies are subject to a 30% tax rate. Assuming no change in SG&A, which company would experience the biggest increase in profit from a 10% increase in net sales? Which company would experience the biggest decline in profit from a 10% decrease in net sales?

Intuitively, the company with the highest gross profit rate (Borg) would benefit more from an increase in sales (assuming SG&A is not changing). Conversely, Borg will suffer more from a decline in sales. Below is a comparison of effects:
