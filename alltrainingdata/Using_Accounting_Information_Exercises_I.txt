Problem 1
Tile Masters produces two varieties of tile, outdoor and indoor. In recent years, the outdoor tile business unit has failed to meet management’s goals. At the beginning of 20X9, Tile Masters sold the outdoor tile business, resulting in a $375,000 pretax gain. The indoor tile product continues to be very successful. During 20X9, product sales were $10,500,000, at a gross margin of 30%. Selling expenses totaled $1,200,000 and administrative expenses totaled $1,800,000. Tile Masters is subject to a 40% income tax rate. a)	 Prepare the 20X9 income statement assuming that management views the outdoor tile business as a separate and distinct line of business. b)	 Prepare the 20X9 income statement assuming that the outdoor tile business is not a separate and distinct line of business.

Problem 4
Calculate the return on assets and return on equity for the following companies. What appears to be the average interest rate faced by the companies? As a broad generalization, which companies appear to be effectively utilizing debt to improve financial performance?
Interest Expense* $35,000 $280,000 $700,000 $700,000 Preferred Dividends $0 $70,000 $52,500 $350,000

Net Income Price Corp. Clark Corp. Allred Corp. Nilson Corp. $400,000 $300,000 $2,500,000 $1,000,000

Average Assets $3,850,000 $6,650,000 $14,000,000 $21,000,000

Average Equity $3,500,000 $3,850,000 $7,000,000 $14,000,000

* Note: Many analysts use the “after tax” cost of interest (i.e., $1 of interest only costs $0.75 if a company faces a 25% tax rate) in calculating the return on assets. The idea is to determine how much higher income would be without the interest impact. For purposes of this problem you may simply use the interest expense shown.

Worksheet 4
Return on Assets Price Corp. Clark Corp. Allred Corp. Nilson Corp. Return on Equity

Discussion:

Solution 4
Return on Assets* Price Corp. Clark Corp. Allred Corp. Nilson Corp. 11.30% 8.72% 22.86% 8.10% Return on Equity** 11.43% 5.97% 34.96% 4.64% -0.13% 2.75% -12.11% 3.45%

* Return on Assets Ratio = (Net Income + Interest Expense)/Average Assets ** Return on Equity Ratio = (Net Income – Preferred Dividends)/Average Common Equity

Discussion: The interest rate appears to be 10%. Notice that interest expense is about 10% of the average debt. The average debt is estimated as the difference between the average assets and average equity. Price and Allred each have a ROE > ROA. This suggests effective utilization of debt. Notice that these two companies also have an ROA > interest rate. The other two companies have an ROA < interest cost, and this is resulting (generally) in a lower ROE.

Problem 6
MG Corporation was a diversified company with two separate lines of business – automobiles and financial services. At the beginning of 20X8, MG sold its financial services unit, resulting in a $1,500,000 pretax gain. The following additional transactions and events pertain to 20X8: The automobile unit sold an assembly plant at pretax loss of $1,500,000. This asset sale did not represent the sale of a business unit. General information for 20X8 is as follows: Sales, $15,000,000; Cost of Goods Sold, $6,400,000; Selling Expenses, $3,000,000; and General & Administrative Expenses, $2,500,000. The company’s income tax rate is 30%. The company incurred a $350,000 clean-up cost (pretax) associated with an accidental release of potentially hazardous chemicals. The company has very strong controls to prevent such events, and this occurred only because of a series of nonrecurring and unusual system failures. The loss is judged to be extraordinary. MG changed its method of accounting for inventory at the beginning of 20X8. The cost of goods sold of $6,400,000 is based on the new method. Cumulatively, prior years’ income would have been $4,800,000 higher (net of tax effects) had the new method been in use all along. The company discovered an error in a prior year’s report. The error resulted in a $840,000 overstatement of 20X7 net income. a)	 Prepare the 20X8 income statement for MG Corporation. b)	 Retained earnings at January 1, 20X8, was $11,000,000, before giving consideration to the correction of error or accounting change described above. What is the balance of the revised beginning retained earnings? c)	 The company had $800,000 of other comprehensive income (net of any tax effects) related to holding gains on available for sale securities. How much is total “comprehensive income?

Box Corporation has common and preferred stock outstanding at December 31, as follows: 2,000,000 shares of $1 par value common stock. The company started the year with 1,900,000 shares, issued 300,000 shares on May 1, and reacquired 200,000 shares on November 1. 200,000 shares of $100 par value, 5% preferred. These shares have been outstanding all year, and the $1,000,000 dividend was declared and paid during the year. The company’s net income for the full year was $1,529,000. a)	 Compute the company’s basic earnings per share. b)	 Additionally, assume the preferred stock is convertible into 4,000,000 shares of common stock. Compute the company’s diluted earnings per share. For this calculation, the numerator will be net income, as you will assume that the preferred dividend was not paid (“if ” the preferred was converted to common, the preferred dividend would not have been paid). The denominator will be the weighted-average common shares plus the number of shares that would be issued on conversion (i.e., 4,000,000).
