About the author

About the author

My writer name is Pert Mason, and I was born in Copenhagen, Denmark 1960. During the eighties I made myself a career in a supermarket chain. It was one of the first free retailers in Denmark that implemented Information technology (It) systems in its daily operations, both at the offices and the shops. Due to personal experience with computers, I soon got involved with strategic and practical implementation of It systems everywhere in our business. An education as a “business manager with diploma” combined with courses in Project Management and Strategic Leadership put It at work in a perspective to me. Some years later I graduated as a school teacher, and It quickly became integrated in my teaching. I almost felt it as my mission to teach my pupils how to use It, to reduce the struggle with learning Physics and Mathematics. Some years later my mission turned out to only include adults. From 2010 to 2013 I worked as a teacher in It and Economics at Erhvervsskolerne Aars (Business Schools in Aars) and Aarhus Købmandsskole (Retailers School in Aarhus). Since then I have worked as an independent consultant in It and Economics. I have written books for Erhvervsskolernes Forlag (Business School Publishing) and bookboon.com.

Foreword

1	Foreword
This book is aimed at new users of the operating system Windows 8.1, installed on stationary computers or laptops. Users of computers with touchscreens, like tablets, may also enjoy the book, even though navigating on touchscreens is only described in chapter 5.1.3 Navigate on a touchscreen If you are not an experienced user of a computer, you will hopefully find answers to many of your questions in this book. If you are comfortable working with Windows 7 you will probably find many things have changed in Windows 8.1. Windows 8 was undoubtly designed for a touchscreen, with big ‘tappable’ tiles in place of small, fiddly buttons to click on. There are two whole new Graphical User Interfaces: the Start screen and the Apps view (read more in chapter 6 Graphic User Interfaces…). That design has been modified in Windows 8.1 to satify the needs of users using mouse and keyboard. If you read this book from the start to the end you will learn a lot about possible uses and the functionalities of Windows 8.1. But this is not the primary purpose with this book. The idea is, that is nice to have the book as a practical, offline Encyclopedia, that quickly can answer common user questions about Windows 8.1. Users may need -- relevant office programs, like word processing, calculation sheets and so on -- a calender for your lectures, homework, meetings and more -- tools of communication, like webmail, Skype, podio, msn and more -- download1 of materials, like free books at bookboon.com -- social media, like facebook, twitter, instagram, snapchat and so on -- news and weather forecasts -- streaming2 of audio og video, like television programs, YouTube, Spotify and so on -- and a lot of other stuff With Windows 8.1 comes a number of programs, that will satisfy some of the above mentioned needs. Furthermore you can download programs/apps from Windows Store (try e.g. the search text “student” and see what happens), and from various websites on the Internet. Your organisation will probably be able to help you with other needs. The author can not be held responsible for any content on any websites, downloads, hyperlinks or any other things mentioned in this book, since it can be subject to change or misuse. Enjoy your reading.

Operating systems

3	 Operating systems
In this chapter you will learn about -- what an operating system is, generally spoken

3.1	

What is an operating system?

An operating system is the basic software on a computer, that makes it possible to run programs, store data and control the vital ressources of a computer. Operating systems control and coordinate the hardware3 and the software4 that is executed on the computer. To use a symphonic orchestra as metaphor for a computer, one could say that the musicians and their instruments symbolizes the computer hardware, the nodeleaflets with music on symbolizes the computer software, and the orchestral conductor symbolizes the computers operating system. This book is describing the operating system Windows 8.1 by the software company Microsoft. There are lots of other operating systems; e.g. Mac OS, Ubuntu, Android, just to mention a few. There are different opinions of how to define an operating system, and how to define separate programs. However, it is not the authors intention to describe various theoretical terms about operating systems. So, if you want to know more about operating systems, you can do so by searching the Internet, or you can click here.

Upgrading to Windows 8.1

4.1.1	

Upgrading from Windows-versions earlier than 7

If you want to upgrade to  Windows  8.1  from Windows  Vista or Windows  XP, you must install the program from a Windows 8.1-DVD, and perform the upgrading from scratch. This will cause all your existing files, settings and programs to disappear (be sure to take a backup before installation). However, if you decide to upgrade, you must ensure that your computer meets the demands from Microsoft to run Windows 8.1. 4.1.2	 Upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1

On a Microsoft website (click here – and read about original websites here) you can download an “Upgrading assistant” for free. It will automatically scan your PC and verify that it meets the producers demands. A product that worked well with Windows 7, will most likely work well with Windows 8.1. The Upgrading assistant will create a compatibility report, and can help you buy, download and install Windows 8.1. Everything can be done online via the Internet. But it is also possible to buy a DVD with the program, if you prefer this. Remember, if you are a student you might get a discount. The actual upgrading procedure is very well described on Microsofts website, and is therefore not covered here. 4.1.3	 Upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1

In august 2014 Microsoft released Windows 8.1 Update 1 (KB 2919355 = the update name). Microsoft announced that if you didn’t install it, or if you removed it, you would not get future security updates, bug fixes or new functionalitialities. Later Microsoft recommended you to uninstall that update, and replace it with KB 2993651. Later all known problems were solved with a so called update fix. It is confusing, so it is recommended that you read more about known issues with security updates by clicking here.
Which update version is your operating system? If you want to know which Windows updates you have, you can right click on the Windows-icon in the lower, left side of the screen, choose Programs and Features at the top, and then click on View Installed Updates. Here you get all the information you need about updates of Windows and other programs.

Windows 8.1

Upgrading to Windows 8.1

Mitigation Find and then uninstall any of the following updates that are currently installed on your system: •	 KB2982791 •	 KB2970228 •	 KB2975719 •	 KB2975331 KB2993651 replaces these security updates, and resolves known issues. (Source: Microsoft website) It is important to ensure, that all relevant updates of Windows 8 are installed. Type the word “update” on the Start screen, and then choose Windows Update. This will give you an overview of your update options. You can read more about searching from start screen in chapter 8 Searching. When you upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1 your files, apps, user accounts and all other settings are automatically saved.  Windows 8.1 comes with some apps, which updates or replaces earlier installed apps. Existing Windows Store-apps are not included in the update, but when the upgrade is finished, you can reinstall all of them – or just the ones you that want to keep. 

4.2	

Before starting the installation

There are a couple of things that is recommended that you do before you install the update. --  Make a safety backup of your data files. Even though your files will be saved as you install Windows 8.1, it is a good idea to backup your datafiles, by configurering File history. -- Make sure you got enough disc space on your Hard Drive.
How to ensure you got sufficient disc space -Put the mouse pointer in the lower left corner, and right click the Windows-icon. Choose the item System. In the window that opens you can see if you got a 32-bit or a 64-bit-system. If you run Windows 8, you must have 3.000 MB space available to install the 32-bit version of Windows 8.1 and 3.850 MB space available to install the 64- bit version of Windows 8.1. Put the mouse pointer in the lower right corner, choose the Settings-charm, and choose Change PC-settings. Choose PC and Devices, and choose Disc space. Notice the number of Gb available under Free up space on this PC. Your PC need at least a couple of Gb to run correctly. Are you short of disc space, you can try to remove large files or apps. You can also try using the tool Disc cleanup.

Windows 8.1

Upgrading to Windows 8.1

To start upgrading the operating system you must search and find the icon Windows Store on the Start screen or Apps view. The icon looks like this:	 -- Make sure your computers power chord is connected to a power switch. If you run out of power before the installation has finished, the installation might not work properly. -- Make sure you are connected to the internet all the time. If not, you might have to repeat some processes to finish the configuration, and it will take more time. Be aware that if you are using a consumption based plan for the internet connection then this might cost you money. -- Make sure you have the latest Windows updates before you install Windows 8.1. In most cases Windows Update will do this automatically for you. However, if this functionality is not enabled, then you must manually check for updates. To do this write the word “update” in the search field on your Start screen, og choose Windows Update. For more information look under Windows Update: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). -- Turn your antivirus program off. Some antivirusprograms might interrupt the installation. When you have installed Windows 8.1 remember to put your antivirus program back on.

4.3	

Do it

Do not wait for any update notifications from Windows Update, when you upgrade to Windows 8.1! Microsoft made it necessary to open the “app” Windows Store, when you upgrade from Windows 8. When Windows Store is open, it should automatically suggest, that you upgrade to Windows 8.1, provided that you have upgraded your Windows 8 to the latest version! Start upgrading to Windows 8.1! If Windows store does not automatically suggest that you upgrade to Windows 8.1 when you open Windows Store, there can be several reasons: -- You got an Enterprise-version -- You got a Pro-version with volume-license -- You try to install a 64-bit version on a PC that is not compatible with 64-bit -- You use a preview-version of Windows 8 (a real version can be downloaded from Windows Store) -- Try to reset Windows Store. Do it by pressing the Windows-key + R, and type in the word “wsreset.exe”. Restart the computer, and reopen Windows Store. The problem is hopefully solved. Troubleshooting problems around installation of Windows 8.1 is not described further in this book. It is not the purpose of the book, and in many cases it will be the readers organisations system administrator that must solve any such problems! There are quite a large number of websites on the internet that describes various procedures for correcting installation errors – free of charge.

Graphic user interfaces in Windows 8.1

Windows 8.1 has three different graphic user interfaces, which are: -- The Start screen (or just Start) -- The All apps view (or just Apps view) and -- The Desktop In the following the three user interfaces are described separately.

6.1	The Start screen
The start screen is where you have fast access to preferred apps, favorite web sites, often used folders, current work files etc. If you use a Microsoft-account to log in, you get access to your own, individually designed Start screen. This screen you will meet, no matter which windows 8.x PC you use – anywhere in the world.

The start screen is easily recognized by the text Start in the top, left corner.

The graphical user interface of the Start screen (originally called Metro), is similar to that on Windows smartphones. For the manufacturer, Microsoft, it is important, that users easily can shift seamlessly from one Microsoft platform5 to another.

In the upper right corner of the screen the current users name is shown, and a photo of the user, if this has been added. The information shown here corresponds to the data typed in at the log in screen. You can log in locally, or you can use a Microsoft-account (read more in chapter 12.4 Create a Microsoft account). Any PC in the world with Windows 8.1 installed, can give you access to your own individually designed screen. That is, when you use your Microsoft account information to log in.

Windows 8.1

Graphic user interfaces in Windows 8.1

To change user, either log off and log in as a different user, or restart Windows 8.1 and type in the wanted log in data. When you put the mouse pointer in the lower, left corner of the screen, you can log off by right clicking the window button that appears. Then you choose Shut down or sign out and then Sign out. 6.2.2	 On/Off symbol

On the upper, right on the Start screen – to the right of the account information – is the on/off button. If you click on it, a menu appears, with the choices Sleep, Update and shut down and Update and restart. (Maybe the choice Hibernate too, read more in chapter 7.5.1 System under Power Options). 6.2.3	Search To the right hand side of the on/off button is a looking glass. If you click on it, a search field appears, where you can type in text.
From the Start screen, start typing text directly. this will activate the search box, and provide you search results instantly! This might save you a lot of time – use this feature in the future!

6.2.4	Scrollbar The start screen probably has more content (icons) than is shown on the computer screen. To see more you can use the scrollbar at the bottom of the screen. Put the mouse pointer at the scrollbar6 in the bottom of the screen, hold down the left mouse button while you draw the scrollbar to the right. In the same way you can scroll back again, by drawing to the left. 6.2.5	Tiles The Start screen contains a number of tiles, in different sizes and shapes. The number and size of tiles may vary depending upon the tiles that each user has inserted or removed from the individual Start screen. Tile may also be resized, and this also affects the layout and number of tiles to be seen. When you activate a tile (by using with mouse, the keyboard or your fingers) an app, a program, a folder or a file opens. 6.2.6	 Apps and programs

In this book programs that are downloaded from Windows Store and gets opened from the Start menu are referred to as apps, and programs that are downloaded from anywhere else and gets opened from the Desktop menu as programs. However, apps can also be opened from the Taskbar, and Desktop programs can also be opened from the Start menu, so this concept might be a little confusing for the reader. Unfortunately the author have not been able to find better definitions. So if a wrong term is used somewhere in the book, please bear with the author, thank you.

Elements in the Apps view

The Apps view gives you an overview over the apps, that are available. The apps are represented by icons. An icon is an illustration, and an app is a program, but in daily life the two words are often used interchangeably. In this book we therefore sometimes use the word app instead of icon. You may not be able to see all available apps – in the right hand side of the screen there might be apps, though they are not visible. Like with the Start screen, you can scroll sideways, to see the rest of the screen. You move the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen, until the scrollbar is visible. Point at the scrollbar with the mouse pointer, hold down the left mouse button and drag the scrollbar to the right, with the mouse. Moving the scrollbar back and forth you see apps appear and disappear on the screen.

Depending on which type of file or folder you select, more tabs may appear, like Manage or Play, containing relevant tools for working with the selected datatype. Like Search Tools, Library tools, Music tools or Video tools. The File tab contains items that average users rarely use, because there are alternative ways of doing the same operations; open New Window, open Command Prompt, open Windows Power shell, Delete History, Help and Close Window. The Home tab contains tools to help you manage files and folders.

Select the items that you want to copy or move, click Copy to copy them or Cut to move them. Browse to the place where you want the files or folders to go, and click Paste. The rest of the menu items almost goes without saying.

When you have selected the chosen items in the File list, you just click on Zip, and a so-called zip-file is created containing the compressed data. The rest of the icons in Share will not be covered here. If you want to share screenshots, the Charm Share is the easiest way to do it (read more in chapter 7 Charms). Nextto Share is the View tab. In its upper left side it is possible to choose between to see a Preview pane or Details pane.

There are eight different views to choose from. It is useful to get acquainted with the various views. Details view stands out from the rest. If this view is chosen, column headings will appear. This makes it possible to sort in your data, in various ways. Next to the views group, there are more tools to sort your data. You can choose to view item check boxes, file name extensions and Hidden items in File Explorer.

Searching

8	Searching
In this chapter you learn about -searching programs, program items, folders and datafiles

Your computer contains a lot of programs, apps, folders and data. We all have experienced, that finding a specific item can be difficult or even impossible. Your data is stored either on the Hard Drive on the computer, a USB-drive, somewhere on your network or in “the cloud”. If you are storing a lot of data and you do not have an effective filing system, the overview can easily be lost. Efficient search tools are therefore needed when looking for specific textfiles, photos, music, videos.

8.1	

Search from the start screen

From the Start screen you have access to strong search tools the following ways: -- Click on the looking glass in the upper right corner, and type a search text in the search field. Windows search tools will automatically look for all titles with related content, and present results almost immediately. -- The Search Charm has the same functionality as above (read more in chapter 7.1 The Search Charm). -- In the upper right corner of the Start screen is a search icon.
The far easiest way to search for something in Windows 8.1 is simply to write a short text directly on the Start screen. Search results will appear in a panel in the right side of the screen. When you are at the Desktop, the F3-key is a shortcut to open a filesearch box in a panel in the right side of the screen.

To see all of the results for your search term, including all the web results from Bing, tap or click the Search button  8.1.1	  to go to the search results page!

The search results page

Your results are grouped by category and by where they are from. For example, the videos on your PC will be grouped together, and so will the videos from the web. The results from your personal files on your PC and OneDrive will be listed first, and then results from apps and the web. To see all the search results for a specific category, click the See all link for that category.

Searching

Do like this When File Explorer is open, you write a (part of) the name of the file or item in the search box (Search Libraries) at the upper right on the window, and finish by pressing Enter.

Windows 8.1 will display search results that contains the text, if it is a program, a folder, a filename or in the content of one of these. If you make too general searching, you get too many results. The more specific and precise the search terms are, the better results you get.

When you may select one result and choose Details on the Ribbon in the View tab, you get to see details like e.g. filename, author, filesize and more. Notice the eight different Layouts on the Ribbon. They all show the same content, but presented in very different views. It is useful to know these ways. As a standard content is shown in alfabetical order, but there are many other possibilities. In the layout Details you can right-click on the column Name, for example, and choose the criteria Authors, Folder path and Size, one by one. If you want a different order, you simply drag a column to its new place. If you click on the criteria Size, the View changes to descending order of file sizes. If you click once more, it is ascending order. This functionality is the same for all columns in Details.

Storage of datafiles

9.1	

Storage from Apps

Apps like e.g. Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Power point, Publisher, OneNote og Access) and other programs, like photo editing apps, do all create data files that can be stored. It is typically done by clicking the tab Files, and choosing the item Save as and then choose a storage place. If you choose to store locally on the computer, a dialog box is opened, and you can save your data anywhere on the computers drives. Do you use a Microsoft-account, you can save the data on your OneDrive, your personal drive in the sky. Read more about this in chapter 12.6 OneDrive.

9.2	

Storage from Desktop-programs

Programs that are opened from the Desktop, and that creates datafiles to be stored, can also use OneDrive. There are advantages by using OneDrive: -- Data are accessable from all computers with internet connection. -- Data does not take space on local drives. -- Data are easy to share with others. There are also disadvantages by using OneDrive: -- Storage time is depending on the internet connection speed. -- Data is not accessable without an internet connection. Storage from Desktop programs are similar to storage from apps.

9.3	

Libraries

If you store many data files, finding data files again becomes more difficult – especially if they are not well organized on the computers drives. You save time by keeping your data files well organized. There is no fixed rule for organizing data files, but using Libraries is very common. A library is a collection of items, files and folders. The items may be located on your computer, on an external drive or even on an external computer. When you include a folder in a library, its files are shown in the library, but everything is still stored on the original location. You never store datafiles directly in a library, but on any given drive, that is included in a library. The library contains shortcuts to the physical location where the actual data (and program) files are saved. Windows has some standard libraries: dokuments, pictures, music, programs and videos. It is possible to change these names, and it is also possible to create your own libraries and remove them. Please notice that when you select libraries like Pictures, Music and Video, then the respective tool tabs will automatically appear on the ribbon.

Computer connections

10	 Computer connections
In this chapter you learn about ----computer security network types external drives printers

To perform various actions with your folders and/or datafiles, it is necessary to know about different types of connections to your computer. The most important connections, besides mouse and keyboard, are: networks, printers and USB-drives. CD-rom/DVD-drives have almost become obsolete technology for computers, and if you buy yourself a new computer, it will probably not have such a drive.

10.1	Networks
Your computer is probably connected to at least one network. A network is a number of computers connected to each other, so exchange of data is possible. In the following the network types LAN, WLAN og WAN are described. A so called LAN (Local Area Network) is a wired network at home or at work. Only those directly connected to the network by cables, have access. This type of network is very secure. If the network is wireless, it is called a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network). If it complies to international standards, it is also called a Wi-Fi. If you know the access code to a Wi-Fi-network, you can get access. WLAN is therefore less secure than a LAN, but easier and cheaper to set up. The use of wireless networks are common to laptops and smartphones. An intranet is a local network for invited users. It is common in public institutions, but also a lot of companies use it. As a invited user you can get connected to the intranet, by using a unique username, and a password. An extranet is a network used by companies and other organizations to communicate with their businesspartners, and works exactly like an intranet. When you order products from a company, it is typically through the companys extranet. Finally there is a WAN (Wide Area Network) which is a network between cities or contries. The Internet – or just “the net” – is the largest WAN we have. Read more about the Internet in chapter 12 The Internet.

10.2	CD-rom/DVD-drives

CD-rom/DVD-drive have been standard equipment for computers for a long time. They are no longer installed on new computers, as they are being replaced by other, newer technologies, like streaming, USB-drives and others. It is (still) possible to buy and connect an external DVD-drive to a new computer, so you can watch your DVD-movies, show/save data and so on. To watch DVD-movies you need an app, like Windows Media Center, that can be downloaded from Windows Store (read more about this in chapter 13 Windows store). CD-rom and DVD-drives will not be described further.

USB-drives

Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a so called data communication bus, that transports data from one place to another.

All contemporary computer have one or more USB-ports, so USB-drives can be connected to all new computers. A USB-drive can contain from a few Gigabyte (Gb11) data up to 64 Gb or more – the amount is increasing all the time. Compared to a DVD (that typically contains 4,7 Gb) an USB-drive of 500 GB can store the equivalent of more than 100 DVDs. Furthermore much longer to copy 500 GB of data to DVD than to USB-drives The faster and more practical USB-drives are far more efficient.
USB comes in various speed variants, the high speed drives are compatible with low speed drives. It is important to notice which kind of USB ports that your computer have, and which kind of USB-drive you insert: ----USB 3.0 high-speed 4.86 Gbps (SuperSpeed USB) USB 2.0 high-speed 480 Mbit/s USB 1.0/1.1 full-speed 12 Mbit/s USB 1.0/1.1 low-speed 1,5 Mbit/s (mostly used for mouse, keyboard and modem)

USB 3.0 ports can also handle USB 2.0 Drives – but at the slower pace.

10.4	Printers
A printer can be connected directly to a computer e.g. via a USB-plug, or be connected to a network.

All computers that are connected to a network, can print on a network-printer that is connected to the same network.

Add a printer

Usually, an installation CD will – still – be delivered with the printer. The CD will automatically begin the installation when inserted in the CD-drive, and when you follow the instructions, it is easy. If your computer does not your computer have a CD-drive, the installation program must be downloaded from the Internet. Installation of network printers are more difficult than USB-printers, as it sometimes may be necessary to know how to use codes and IP-adresses12. However, if it is a wireless network printer, and you have a WPS-button (Wi-Fi Protected Setup button) on your Router or Access Point, it is very easy. Depending of the equipment there are several variations of connecting the printer, so you need to look at the printer manual. 10.4.2	Print The keyboard shortcut for Print is Ctrl+P in all Microsoft-programs. This command will also work in most other programs. Alternatively you must find a Print command in the Files –tab to print.

In general software programs can be split into the following two types: -- Computer oriented programs. -- User oriented programs.

11.1	

Computer Oriented programs

Security programs, maintenance programs and service programs are computer oriented programs that are crucial to the functionality of the computer. Ideally, you would like these programs to work automatically and stay in the background, minding their own business (and the sanity of your computer). Some day it will perhaps be like that, but that day has yet to come. 11.1.1	 PC security

Drives that are connected to the computer, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and so on, are called external drives. When your computer are connected to external drives, it is possible for malware to find a way into your computer. Malware is a common name for malicious programs, such as vira, trojan horses, worms, adware,spyware and many more. Malware can transmit information about you or the computer to a third party, making the computer go slower or, in the worst case damage the files on your computer so much that is becomes in-operable. To protect your computer, it is absolutely recommended at least to install: -- an active firewall. -- an efficient antivirus program. Firewall Example You want an active firewall on your computer, to protect it from unwanted intrusion. Do like this When you are on the Start screen, just write “firewall” with your keyboard. Windows will automatically find relevant results of this search. Click on the suggestion “Windows Firewall”. Windows Firewall is sufficient protection for most users, when activated.

Notice that it is possible to cleanup System files, by clicking the button Clean up system files. Select the files you want to delete (notice the size of the files, big files are to prefer), and click on OK. Remember that your Recycle Bin might contain large amounts of data that needs to be deleted. Optimize When you store a file on your Hard Drive, it will be placed in the first available space. When you delete and store new files to the Hard Drive, there will become holes in the row of files. If a new file cannot be in a hole, it might be scattered all over the Hard Drive. This is called Hard Drive fragmentation. Fragmentation causes the computer to use more time to read the file. With the feature Defragment all relevant files on your Hard Drive gets sorted and placed together in sequences on the Hard Drive. Windows 8.1 has an optimizing feature, that used to be called Defragment, but is now called Defragment and optimize drives. The purpose of this feature is to organize the computers file systems in a better and more efficient way, to make the computer go faster and use less resources. As a standard Windows 8.1 optimizes the computer automatically every week, but you can do it manually too. Example You want to optimize you computer manually.

Service programs

Beside the above mentioned, other service programs are vital to ensure the computer functions correctly. The most important ones are described in the following. Java Java and Javascript are programming languages. Lots of apps and websites will not function correctly without them. Java is e.g. used for the danish Nem Id, used by netbanking, public management and so on. The problem with using Java instead of Javascript, is that the program needs updating all the time, while Javascript doesn’t, so the Java-browserplugin will be replaced in the future. Until then we must use it and update it. Example You have received information that it is necessary to have the latest version of Java installed. You want to check which version you have, and perhaps update to the latest one. Do like this Open Control panel (e.g. right click on the Window-logo in the left side of the Taskbar, and choose Control Panel). Write “Java” in the search box. Click on the search result Java, and a dialog box will open. In the tab General you can click on the About-button to see information about your Java-version.

It is a good idea to mix lower- and uppercase letters, even though not all websites distinguish between them. The more complex your password is, the safer you are.

Disable automatic maintenance

The goal of Automatic Maintenance is to combine all background maintenance activity in Windows and help third-party developers add their maintenance activity to Windows, without negatively impacting performance and energy efficiency. Additionally, Automatic Maintenance enables users as well as enterprises to be in control of maintenance activity scheduling and configuration. However, some users experience that Automatic Maintenance takes too long time, and causes very high CPU usage, so they prefer to do it manually. If you want to disable automatic maintenance, do like this: -- Press Windows-key+r to open the Run dialog box. -- Type taskschd.msc and click on OK. -- In the left pane of Task Scheduler, click on to expand Task Scheduler, go to Library, Microsoft, Windows, and finally TaskScheduler. -- In the middle pane of TaskScheduler, either right click on or select the Regular Maintenance task (see also screenshot below). -- Click on Disable, and close Task scheduler.

Shut down a computer in “coma”

Sometimes a computer can go into “coma”, which means it does not response to any action you take. If your computer is a notebook, it is not enough to remove a power chord, since the built-in battery will have the computer turned on for hours. Using an alternative method can be necessary. Press down the button with the symbol , and keep it down, untill the computer is shut down. It is not the entirely correct way to shut it down, since it skips important processes, but it can be necessary and does not harm your computer in any way.
