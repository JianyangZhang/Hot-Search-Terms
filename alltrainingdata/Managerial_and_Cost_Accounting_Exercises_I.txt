Problem 1

Problem 1
Armor World manufacturers armored cars. The armor provides low level balistics protection. Cars are made to customer specifications via orders submitted over an internet site. The cars are completed and shipped in about one day. As a result, Armor World does not maintain any work in process or finished goods inventory. The following costs were incurred in producing and selling mats during July: Steel used in the armoring	 Armor grade glass for windows	 Factory rent	 Electricity to run the welding equipment	 Labor cost of welders	 Internet sales site	 Administrative salaries	 Depreciation of welding equipment	 Salary of factory safety inspector	 Office rent	 $67,150 7,000 4,800 1,300 17,050 750 6,250 3,700 1,750 6,750

Evaluate these costs, and determine the amount of direct material, direct labor, factory overhead, and selling/general/administrative costs. Next, identify how much is considered to be a “prime cost” and how much is considered to be a “conversion cost.”

The prime costs are $91,200, consisting of direct labor and direct materials ($74,150 + $17,050). The conversion costs are $35,600, consisting of direct labor and factory overhead ($17,050 + $18,550).

Problem 2
Deerbound Manufacturing transferred $3,000,000 of raw materials into production during the most recent year. Direct labor and factory overhead for the period totaled $2,000,000. Beginning work in process was $670,000 and ending work in process was $850,000. Finished goods inventory decreased by $50,000. If gross profit was $1,000,000, how much was sales for the period?

Solution 2
Total manufacturing costs were $5,000,000 ($3,000,000 + $2,000,000). Of this total cost entering production, $4,820,000 was transferred to finished goods (the other $180,000 remained in work in process ($850,000 – $670,000)). Given that finished goods inventory decreased, the total cost of goods sold was $4,870,000 ($4,820,000 transferred into finished goods + $50,000 decrease in finished goods). Total sales equaled $5,870,000 ($4,870,000 cost of goods sold + $1,000,000 gross profit).

a)	
BUBBLE BOBBER CORPORATION SCHEDULE OF COST OF GOODS MANUFACTURED For the month ending October 31, 20X5 Direct materials: Beginning raw materials inventory, Oct. 1 Plus: Net purchases of raw materials Raw materials available Less: Ending raw materials inventory, Oct. 31 Raw materials transferred to production Direct labor Factory overhead Indirect materials Indirect labor Factory utilities and maintenance Factory depreciation Other factory related overhead Total manufacturing costs Add: Beginning work in process inventory, Oct. 1 Less: Ending work in process, Oct. 31 Cost of goods manufactured $	313,750 222,250 1,140,000 141,500 61,000 1,878,500 $	8,918,500 1,942,500 $	10,861,000 1,792,500 $	9,068,500 $	2,416,000 5,863,750 $	8,279,750 2,045,500 $	6,234,250 805,750

b)	 Bubble Bobber’s finished goods inventory decreased by $931,500 ($10,000,000 – $9,068,500). It is important for students to sense that less cost was transferred into finished goods (the cost of goods manufactured/$9,068,500) than was transferred out of finished goods (the cost of goods sold/$10,000,000).

Problem 4

Solution 4
a1)	 25% of the raw materials purchases remain in ending raw materials inventory. (25% × $10,500,000 = $2,625,000). a2)	 The total amount placed into process was $20,125,000 (($10,500,000 × 75%) + $7,000,000 + $5,250,000)). Of this amount, 40% remains in work in process inventory ($20,125,000 × 40% = $8,050,000). a3)	 The amount transferred to finished goods from work in process was $12,075,000 ($20,125,000 × 60%). Of this amount, 20% remains in finished goods inventory ($12,075,000 × 20% = $2,415,000). b1)	 The amount transferred to finished goods from work in process was $12,075,000 ($20,125,000 × 60%). Of this amount, 80% was allocated to cost of goods sold ($12,075,000 × 80% = $9,660,000). b2)	 The SG&A is a period cost, and is entirely charged against income during the year ($2,450,000). c)		 The total deprecation is $1,400,000 (($5,250,000 × 15%) + ($2,450,000 × 25%)). Of this amount, $378,000 ($5,250,000 × 15% × 60% transferred to finished goods × 80% sold) is charged against income. The remaining amount is allocated to work in process and finished goods inventory.

Problem 5

Problem 5
Old World Furniture constructs and sells executive style conference tables. The selling price is $15,000 per table. A unique feature is that the only raw material used in the construction of each table, other than indirect materials like glues and screws, comes entirely from a single tree. Tree prices and other costs of production have remained stable, and Old World is able to use each tree purchased without incurring any significant spoilage. Consider the following “disorganized” information and complete the indicated requirements. Ending work in process (900 tables)	 Selling price per table	 Ending finished goods (300 tables)	 Indirect labor incurred during the period	 Beginning finished goods (600 tables)	 Cost of glues and screws	 Beginning work in process	 Ending raw materials (750 trees)	 Direct labor incurred during the period	 Selling, general, and administrative costs incurred	 Depreciation of factory equipment	 All other factory overhead	 Tables sold (1,200 tables)	 a)	 Complete the reconciliation of units on the accompanying blank worksheet, showing the “unit” activity in raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. b)	 Calculate the cost of goods manufactured. c)	 Calculate the cost of goods sold. d)	 Calculate net income. Assume an income tax rate of 30%. $ 2,700,000 15,000 2,100,000 187,500 4,200,000 52,500 2,197,500 750,000 4,950,000 1,725,000 112,500 450,000

Raw materials transferred into production (1,050 trees)	1,050,000

Raw material purchases during the period (1,350 trees)	1,350,000

Problem 5

Solution 5
a)	
Raw Materials Beginning balance Purchases/transfers in Transfers out/sales Ending balance 450 1350 (1050) 750 Work in Process 750 1050 (900) 900 Finished Goods 600 900 (1200) 300

The bold values are given within the problem, and the italicized amounts are “solved.” Because costs are stable in this problem (e.g., $1,000 per tree), the choice of inventory method (FIFO, average, etc.) does not come into play. In addition, note the 1:1 correspondence between raw material and finished goods. Point out to your students that subsequent chapters will build upon these basic concepts to reflect alternative inventory methods and multiple raw material inputs. Point out that the “per unit” cost assigned to beginning and ending work in process may vary depending upon the stage of completion of production. b)
