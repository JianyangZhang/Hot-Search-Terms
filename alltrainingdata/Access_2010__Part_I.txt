Guide Information
Introduction
Access 2010 is a powerful Database application that allows users to produce tables, forms, queries and reports within a datbase it can also contain calculations, graphs, pictures and files.. access to web data and sharepoint information is available to be built in to the database an extemely powerful database application. All graphics related to Microsoft in this book is in compliance with Microsoft guidelines and thus permitted by Microsoft.

How To Use This Guide
This manual should be used as a point of reference following attendance of the introductory level Access 2010 training course. It covers all the topics taught and aims to act as a support aid for any tasks carried out by the user after the course. The manual is divided into sections, each section covering an aspect of the introductory course. The table of contents lists the page numbers of each section and the table of figures indicates the pages containing tables and diagrams.

Objectives
Sections begin with a list of objectives each with its own check box so that you can mark off those topics that you are familiar with following the training.

Instructions
Those who have already used a database before may not need to read explanations on what each command does, but would rather skip straight to the instructions to find out how to do it. Look out for the arrow icon which precedes a list of instructions.

Appendices
The Appendices list the Ribbons mentioned within the manual with a breakdown of their functions and tables of shortcut keys.

Access 2010: Part I

The Basics

The Access Screen
Window Border The box that surrounds the Access screen when it is not maximised is called the window border. When the mouse is over the border, the pointer changes from a single to a double-headed arrow ‚Äì clicking and dragging with this shape allows the window to be resized. Title bar The coloured bar that appears at the top of the Access window. The title bar tells you which application you are using and if the document you are in is maximised, it will also contain the name of the document. If the Access window is not maximised, by positioning the mouse over the title bar and clicking and dragging, you can move the Access window to a new location on the screen.

Maximise button When working in a document, the Access screen contains two windows, an application window and a document window. You can maximise both windows to capitalise on the space you have on-screen. If you would like the window that your Access application is in to fill up the whole screen, click the outermost maximise button. You may find that the document you are in can still be bigger ‚Äì click the inner maximise button to fill the remaining space within the Access application window.

Minimise button This button is very useful if you need to temporarily switch from Access into another application without closing Access down completely. Click the minimise button to shrink Access to an icon on the task bar; you will then be able to view other icons and applications you may wish to access. When you are finished and ready to continue, click the Access icon from the task bar to resume. The innermost minimise button will minimise the current document window.

Restore button This button only appears when a window is maximised. A maximised window has no border and you cannot see what is behind it. If you want to put the window back inside its border so that you can move and size it, click the restore button. Close button This button is used to close a window. If you click the close button for a document window you close the document. The last button will close the Access application.

Look at a group type on the ribbon such as font and in the bottom right hand corner of that group you may see a small box with a narrow, clicking this is an other method to callup a dialogue box, this time, directly from the ribbon. Many dialogue boxes may be more familiar if you have used Access before.

Toolbar
There are only two tool bars with in the new version of Office 2010 there is the quick access tool bar seen here next to the File tab, and there is the mini toolbar

Quick Access Toolbar By default there are only three buttons on the quick access tool bar but these can be edited and other regularly used buttons can be placed there. Using the drop down menu next to the quick access tool bar will allow the customisation of this toolbar adding your most often used commands. Mini Tool bar When ever text is selected within Access a small formatting tool bar will appear above the highlighted text it will disappear if the mouse cursor is move away from the tool bar and will reappear when the mouse cursor is moved over the highlighted text again

Task Pane
At ask pane is a window that collects commonly used actions in one place. The taskpaneen ables you to quickly createormodify a file, perform a search, or view the clipboard.

It is a Web-style area that you can either, dock along the right or left edge of the window or float any where on the screen. It displays information, commands and controls for choosing options. Like links on a Webpage, the commands on a taskpane are highlighted in blue text, they are underlined when you move the mouse pointer over them, and your unthem with a single click. At ask pane is displayed automatically when you perform certain tasks, for example when you choose clipart from the INSERT, Ribbon, to insert a picture

Ribbons Explained
One of the biggest changes in Access 2010 is the removal of menus. Instead of having a list of menu commands to choose from (including a number of options that are greyed out and not accessible), Access 2010 features a more intuitive control system of tabs. Each tab contains a certain group of commands relevant only to the tab. The commands are listed in the ribbon. Consider the Home ribbon tab that is selected in the diagram above. Beneath the tab is a listing of all commands that are performed most often on the currently selected object, contained in what Microsoft refers to as the ‚Äòribbon‚Äô:

Access 2010: Part I

The Basics

The ribbon was designed to allow access to all functionality of a tab at once. Also, the commands in the ribbon are only the commands that are available for use at the time. We will learn in this lesson how the ribbon works and some of the tools that are available.

About Ribbons
There are two main types of ribbons: general (or command) and contextual. The general ribbons (and corresponding tabs) are always visible when you are viewing a database file in Access:

Command Tabs
Along the top of the window are the command tabs:

In the past, the Office package made use of menus that contained a listing of commands. At their core, the command tabs are essentially the same thing as menus but with a few big changes. For starters, the grouping of commands in tabs is much more intuitive. The commands listed under each tab are also the only commands that are applicable to your current view of the database. Access 2010 takes this one step further with the addition of contextual tabs. The tab labelled Fields and Table are a subset of the table toolsn and appears only when you have selected a table in Datasheet view. These tabs will contain even more specific commands that can be used on a table being viewed and will only be visible when a table is being viewed. The command tabs listed here include many of the most common commands you will perform in Access. The Home ribbon contains the majority of the most common tasks including the ability to switch views, formatting, and filtering of data. If you want to make a new database object, click the Create tab and select the object you want to make. The External Data command tab gives you all the flexibility to import and export data to and from your database, computer, and network. The Database Tools tab gives you the ability to manage the data in your database, create macros, and view relationships.

Contextual Tabs
Contextual tabs appear only when a certain type of database object is selected (or brought into context). For example, if you are looking at a table in datasheet view, a contextual tab will appear showing you the commands you can perform on the table while only in datasheet view:

Access 2010: Part I

The Basics

When using a command in the ribbon, simply click it with your mouse. The command will be performed, or the appropriate tool or dialogue box will appear to help you perform the task. If you are unsure what a certain command does, point to it, but do not click it. Tips After a quick moment a description will appear. This is true for most of the commands:

Navigation Pane
On the left side of the Access window is the Navigation Pane. It is always visible on the left side of the screen, but can be expanded ( ) or shrunk ( of the database objects. Click the pull-down arrow beside the Navigation Pane title ( ) to show a list of all object categories: ) by clicking the double arrows. The Navigation Pane allows quick and easy access to any

Object Tabs

In previous versions of Access, any open database object was opened in its own window and designed to ‚Äòfloat‚Äô inside the Access Screen. When several database objects were open at once, it was difficult to navigate through all of the windows easily. Access 2010 has solved that problem by using tabs: Simply click any of the tabs visible on the top to show the database object. Opening many database objects will create left and right facing arrows ( and ); click on the arrow to scroll that direction through the open database objects. If you ) located beside the tabs. want to close an object you are no longer using, click the Close button (

About Smart Tags
Smart Tags, first introduced in Microsoft Office XP, make it easier for you to complete some of the most common tasks in Access 2010 and provide you with more control over automatic features. You do not have to complete any additional steps to make the Smart Tags appear or disappear in Access. The Paste Options, AutoCorrect Options and AutoFit smart tags appear automatically to allow you to quickly choose actions and remain in place until you begin another action. For example, when you complete a paste operation, the Paste Options smart tag (below) remains in place alongside your text until you begin typing new text.

A ‚Äúsmart tag‚Äù is a type of button in Microsoft Access 2010 that appears after certain actions, such as an automatic text correction or a copy-and-paste, have taken place. The button has a menu of options that help you control the result of the action. For instance, if Access automatically capitalizes the first letter of a word, but you want the word lowercased in this instance, you can click the ‚Äúundo capitalization‚Äù option on the button menu to reverse the action.

Access 2010: Part I

The Basics

Access includes several of these smart tag buttons. They function similarly but their look can vary and each has a specific purpose.

Auto correct Options Smart Tag

The AutoCorrect Options Smart Tag appears after an automatic correction or change, such as a lowercased letter that‚Äôs changed to a capital or a network path that‚Äôs converted to a hyperlink. The Smart Tag shows as a small, blue box when you rest the mouse pointer near text that was changed; it then becomes a button icon which, when you point to it and click it, displays a menu. If you don‚Äôt want the correction, use the options on the menu to undo it; turn off this type of correction completely; or connect to the AutoCorrect dialogue box to adjust settings.

Paste Options Smart Tag

The Paste Options Smart Tag gives you greater control and flexibility in choosing the format for a pasted item. The Smart Tag appears just below a pasted item, such as text, a table, or a slide, with options for formatting. For example, if you copy and paste a slide and insert it after a slide that uses a different design template, you can choose to retain the original design for the slide or let the pasted slide assume the design of the slide it now follows.

Autofit Options Smart Tag

The AutoFit Options Smart Tag appears when Access resizes text you‚Äôre typing to make it fit the current placeholder. If you don‚Äôt want the text to be resized, you can select options on the Smart Tag menu to undo the resizing or to connect to the AutoCorrect dialogue box to turn AutoFit settings off. Also, for single-column layouts, you can change to a twocolumn layout, start a new slide to accommodate the text, or split the text between two slides.

Automatic Layout Options Smart Tag

Access 2010: Part I

The Basics

The Automatic Layout Options Smart Tag appears after you insert an item, such as a picture, diagram, chart, or table, that changes the initial layout of the slide. To accommodate the added item, Access will automatically adjust the slide layout. If you want, use the options to undo the automatic layout or turn it off completely.

New Features In Access 2010
If you are familiar with previous versions of Access, there are a large number of new features and a completely new interface in Access 2010. If you have never used Access before, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì you will quickly become very familiar with these commands as time goes on!

New Interface Design
Commands hidden in four different menu layers are a thing of the past with Access 2010.). Commands are now organized using a new action tab scheme. Under each tab are the commands relevant to the action described on the tab. This command set is referred to as the ‚Äòribbon.‚Äô Finally, Access 2010 features contextual tabs showing data that is relevant only to the current object you are working on. We will explore the new interface in more detail later.

Access 2010: Part I New Template Categories

The Basics

Access 2010 features eleven new templates, each with their own defined tables, forms, reports, queries, and relationships. They are designed to let you start working right away, but are also completely customizable. More Intuitive Sorting and Filtering Access 2010 lets you pick from several predefined sorting methods with just a couple of clicks. Access also features a contextual quick sorting method using plain language. For example, if you have a column of numbers, Access can sort them Smallest to Largest. If you have a column of dates, Access can sort them from Oldest to Newest. New Layout View When working with forms and reports, Access 2010 features an in-between view called Layout View. It allows you to see a live form or report with real data in it, but also lets you adjust the position of certain elements in your form or report on the fly. You can also define ‚Äòmini layouts‚Äô that allow you to move several controls as a group. Access still features the more in-depth Design view, used to fine tune every aspect of a control. Enhanced Tooltips When you hover your mouse above certain command icons, Access 2010 lists the command name, a short description of the command, and an example (if applicable). (Tooltips in previous Office programs listed only the command name.) Automatic Calendar When entering information into a Date field, a small icon will appear allowing you to choose a date from a small calendar. This eliminates the need to enter a date as 03/22/2010 ‚Äì just open the calendar and pick the date! Rich Text in Memo Fields If a table makes use of a memo field, data can now be stored as something other than plain text. Using an HTML-based text format, Access lets you automatically add colours, sizes, and formatting to the text in a memo field. Quickly Create New Objects using the Insert Tab In previous versions of Access, you had to move and minimize windows to find the Database window, pick the category of database object, and then choose to create a new object. With the Insert tab and ribbon, you can create a form based on a table with only two clicks (versus as many as a dozen clicks in the past). If you need a new table at any point, simply click Table on the Insert tab and start entering data. Access 2010 even lets you paste data directly from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Data types and formatting will be found and preserved automatically. Total Row in Datasheet View Every table in Datasheet view features an automatic Total Row at the bottom. You can find the sum, count, average, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, or variance using the Total Row.

Access 2010: Part I Field Templates

The Basics

In the past, it was potentially a long and tedious task to mould a number data type into a usable field for your organization. Now, you can simply click and drag a predefined field from a list right into your table at any point. Field List Task Pane When creating a query in previous versions of Access, each table had to be inserted into Design view in order to use various fields. Now, all fields in all tables are visible in a list. Just drag and drop the ones you need. Split Forms A Split Form is new to Access 2010; it combines Datasheet and Form view together as one. The Datasheet view can be placed on the top, bottom, left, or right side of the Form. Multivalued Fields A single field can contain multiple values in Access 2010. Imagine you have a product that falls into a few different categories. In previous versions of Access and other database management programs, this would have required a manyto-many relationship to be defined. Access 2010 handles this complicated background relationship with only an extra click when designing a field. Attachment Data Type If you want to e-mail a document to a co-worker or some pictures to family members, the files would be sent as an attachment to the e-mail. Access 2010 features a similar attachment data type that can hold documents, charts, sound files, binary files, or any other type of file. Attachments are also automatically compressed when necessary to reduce the overall size of the database file. Alternating Background Colour Datasheet view, reports, and long forms now feature the ability to alternate the background colours of each row. Long lists of data become much easier to read! Navigation Pane The Navigation Pane is an ever-present feature on the left side of the Access window. It contains a listing of all objects currently contained in the database. The Navigation Pane can also be collapsed to make more room in the window. Embedded Macros Though macros go beyond the scope of this manual, macros in Access 2010 are stored inside a database object instead of being a separate object. This makes these macros much safer to use.

Access 2010: Part I Newly Designed Help

The Basics

Office 2010 makes wide use of Office Online, a resource on the Internet to find help on a certain topic. Access 2010 also has different help levels; if you are an end-user rather than a developer who makes database code, you can tailor the help file to search only the more basic topics. Increased and Enhanced Connectivity One of the goals of Office 2010 was to create a centralized location where members of your organization can meet and share data over the Internet. Though many of these features are more advanced topics of Access not covered in this manual, Access features a huge variety of SharePoint services. Access lets you: Collect data from Microsoft Outlook Store and retrieve data on a SharePoint server Integrate with SharePoint Workflow services Retrieve data from linked SharePoint lists Store a SharePoint list offline for use away from your organization Create and save import or export operations if you perform the same online task multiple times Export Data to PDF or XPS You can export a form, report, or datasheet as a PDF (Portable Document Format) or XPS (XML Paper Specification) to easily print, post, and e-mail regardless of the computer platform your intended recipient(s) are using.

Access 2010: Part I New Report View

The Basics

Report view allows you to browse your report without having to print or preview it. You can also sort and filter records on the fly. Enhanced Group, Sort, and Total Feature You can apply new grouping and sorting levels much easier with Access 2010. Grouping is done following a natural sentence structure; you simply fill in the blanks along the way. Additional Security Features Though many of the security features go beyond the scope of this manual, Access 2010 (and indeed the entire Office 2010 suite) features a number of security enhancements and SharePoint services. This functionality includes: Enhanced security by disabling macros and code only until needed Revision tracking to see who modified what and when Permission setting to restrict data modification Restore deleted data from the SharePoint Recycle Bin in case of accidental deletion Open forms and reports using SharePoint even if Access is not open on your computer Keep track of changes made to memo fields

Access and Windows
The Microsoft Office packages were primarily designed to run in the Microsoft Windows operating system. Further iterations of the Office package have been ported for use in other operating systems, such as the Macintosh operating systems. Because the Office package is designed to run in a particular environment, it is also capable of using some features of the operating system (as well as being limited by some of the operating system‚Äôs shortfalls!). In this lesson we will explore the operation of Access 2010 as a whole.

Recovering Access
Despite the best efforts of network administrators, programmers, and home users, there will inevitably come the time where something will go wrong. Viruses, spyware, power outages, and equipment failures can cause havoc if you are unprepared. However, you do have some tools available to use if you get stuck while using Access. Much of the data manipulation done in Access is saved automatically as soon as a particular operation has completed. For example, when you add data to a table, it is saved in the table as soon as the cursor moves to another field. The other manual operations that can be performed in Access, such as the development of macros, forms and reports, must be saved by the user. However, Access does have a general AutoSave feature that is used every 10 minutes to save any work that has been done.

Access 2010: Part I

The Basics

Should Access itself seem unresponsive, there might be a number of causes. If your computer is experiencing heavy network traffic or processor load, some operations regarding Access are placed in a priority queue. With the speed and capability of today‚Äôs computers, this delay will likely be minor. Nonetheless, the best first option is to wait for a few moments. If you see no activity, try opening another program on your computer. If the other program does not start, then you computer is likely stuck in a processing loop somewhere.

Task Manager
Pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete in the Windows 2000/XP environment will open the Task Manager. Check the Applications tab. should you see (Not Responding) beside Access or some other program, highlight the program in the list and click End Task. If you don‚Äôt see any unresponsive programs, it may be a background process. Click the Processes tab. Scroll up and down through the list of processes. You see one program with a 99% CPU usage, that process is likely stuck. Highlight the process and click End Task. If you manage to close Access without having to restart your computer, Access will have saved a backup file in the same folder as the original working file. The backup file will be named filename_Backup. If worst comes to worst and you cannot shut down Windows or end a process, you must physically power off or restart your computer.

Using the Quick Access Toolbar

In the previous lesson, we introduced the new layout changes to Access 2010. In this section, we will learn a little bit more about each part of the new interface and how it works. This lesson will focus on features and customization options available with the Quick Access toolbar, located in the upper left-hand corner of the screen:

About The Default Buttons
Access features three default commands in the Quick Access toolbar: Save Saves the most recent changes to the current database file. Print Opens the Print dialogue box allowing you to adjust different print settings. Undo The Undo command will revert most changes made in Access. For example, if you made a formatting change to a form that you were not happy with, click the Undo button to go back one command. There is a small pull-down arrow beside the Undo button; click this to see a listing of the last few tasks that were performed. Click any task in the list to undo all commands to that point.

Adding Buttons
As you become more familiar with Access you might find it handy to have another command quickly available for use. Though the command tabs and ribbon significantly reduce the number of clicks it takes to do something, you might want to have a particular command always available. Access allows you to add the command to the Quick Access toolbar.

For example, some of us have difficulty with spelling. Fortunately, many programs (including Access) feature a spell checking feature. In Access 2010, the spell checking feature is located in the Records section of the Home command tab:

What is Microsoft Access?
The primary function of Microsoft Office Access 2010 is an information management program. Information is stored in separate lists called tables, and information in one table may relate to information in one or more other tables. These groups of information, when considered together as a whole, become a database. Access is designed to use the data in these databases to extract the information relevant to your situation. Access can also generate reports (such as quarterly sales by each employee) based on the data contained in the database. The Office 2010 package also features a lot of interconnectivity between the various programs, including a newly designed SharePoint service that lets users in your organization connect and share information using a special data centre via the Internet.

The new interface design of Access 2010 makes it easy for novice and expert users alike to get working right away. Now that we know a little bit more about the Getting Started page, let‚Äôs examine the major pieces of the interface that is visible when a file is opened. In this diagram, we can see the File Tab and Quick Access toolbar present in the upper left-hand corner. At the bottom of the diagram is the Status bar, telling us that we are currently viewing a table in Datasheet view. Now let‚Äôs explore the real power of Access 2010, including the use of tabs and the ribbon.

Using the Getting Started Window
The Getting Started window appears every time you open Access without directly opening a file, or after you close an opened database without actually closing Access. Before you have your own established database(s) you can work on, you will likely visit this page every time you want to create a new database or check out the latest information about Access 2010 using Microsoft Office Online.

1.	 Click the Views command to cycle through the different views available for each object. (The type of views available will differ depending on the object that is currently open.) 2.	 You can also click the small down arrow underneath the word View to see all of the available views:

Clipboard
The Clipboard is a special part of the memory of your computer. It is designed to hold an object in temporary memory until it is either placed somewhere else or copied over when a new item enters memory. Before the newer versions of the Windows operating system, a computer could only hold one item at a time in memory. The Office packages have expanded this to a full twenty-four objects whether it is text, spreadsheet data, pictures, or some other piece of data. Items are placed on the clipboard either by selecting some text or object and pressing Ctrl + C on your keyboard. Ctrl + V will paste the object to a new location. Access 2010 gives you full control of the clipboard on your computer. Select an item and use either the Cut or Copy command, followed by the Paste command. The other command in the Clipboard section of the ribbon (marked Format Painter) is only applicable when designing forms or reports and will be covered later.

The other commands will generate a new record in the object, save any record changes, delete a record, apply a calculation field like sum or average, and check the spelling of the current object. Clicking the pull-down arrow beside the More command will show a small menu of more commands that can be performed on the current object: We will explore some of these commands later in this manual.

Sort And Filter
The Sort & Filter section of the Home ribbon will apply some sort of organizational method to a database object:

For example, if you wanted to sort a list of names alphabetically, simply click the column header to select the entire column of names and then click the Sort Ascending command. (We will cover how to perform operations on a table of data later in this manual.)

Find
If your database should grow substantially in size some day, finding a particular value by hand quickly becomes impractical. Access features a Find command to track down the value you are looking for:

Simply enter the search criteria you are looking for and Access will search the current database object to retrieve the information you are looking for. As an addition to the Find command, Access can also replace certain values based on search criteria. For example, if you misspelled a place name or if someone‚Äôs last name has changed, you can use the Replace command to find all instances of a value and replace it with something else.

Create Ribbon
We continue in this section with our exploration of the next main ribbon, the Create Ribbon. The Create ribbon is used to make new database objects:

Tables
Tables are the main objects used in databases. (Without tables, and thus without data, you don‚Äôt have much of a database!) We learned in Section 1 of this manual that a table contains one or more records (or rows of data) and a record contains one or more fields. So, use this section of the ribbon to create the tables you need in order to store the data for your database. Let‚Äôs look at the different options in this section.

Table This will open a new empty table in Datasheet view. You can directly enter data into the field this way or enter Design view to modify the structure of the table by hand. Sharepoint Lists SharePoint Lists are a bit beyond the scope of this manual. Essentially they are tables of data that can be linked to another table stored on a SharePoint server across the room or across the world.

Access 2010: Part I Table Design 3.	 Clicking the Table Design command opens a new empty table in Design View:

Understanding Access

Here you can begin the custom construction of the table as you need it. We will explore more of the functionality of table Design view later in this manual.

Forms
Forms are a way of entering data into a table one record at a time. Forms in Access are comparable to paper forms you would fill out in an office. With a paper form, there is a space for each piece of data required, and once the form is filled out, it will get filed somewhere. The same is true in Access, as you need to have at least one table of data, query, or report in order to make proper use of a form. Use the commands in the Forms section of the Home ribbon to perform different form actions:

Form Use this command to create a new form based on the last highlighted object in the Navigation Pane. Each field in the object will be made into a new field in the new form. (We will explore the use of forms later in this manual.) Navigation This command creates a special kind of form that lets you view more than one record at a time. Multiple item forms are very useful in certain situations.

You can begin constructing a new form right away. Form Wizard This is a step by step tool allowing you to create a form quickly using existing table fields and inbulit formatting options

Reports
Reports are primarily used to summarize the data returned by a query. Reports can also be used to create a complete table contents listing suitable for printing.

Report Clicking the Report button creates a very simple report based on the last highlighted object in the Navigation Pane. We will explore the use of reports later in this manual. Labels There is a good chance most of the databases you will use will have some sort of contact table containing names and addresses. Access features the ability to create a mailing list based on the data in a table. Blank Report This command opens an empty report.

The wizard will walk you through the placement of fields as well as a style and layout that works for you. Report Design This command will open a new blank report in Design View where you can start to manually build a form right away.

Queries
The Queries section of the Create ribbon is devoted to the construction of queries Query Wizard The Query Wizard will walk you through the steps of making a query without requiring any knowledge of database code like SQL (Structured Query Language). Simply pick the fields you want to display in your query and let Access do the rest. Query Design This command will open a new empty query in Design view where you can stipulate with more precision how you want to construct your query.

Macros & Code
Macros are a set of instructions that you can tell Access to perform. For example, if you are performing a fairly large task with many steps frequently in Access, you can design a macro. It works like a script given to a performer; they read the script and deliver the performance the same way each time.

Understanding Access

The modules and visual Basic buttons in this section are designed for database programmers to have Access perform more advanced program functionality.

External Data Ribbon
If you are just starting out with Access, chances are the majority of the databases you will use will be contained on a single machine. You will also likely enter most of the data by hand. This is fine for small databases, but Access gives you the ability to import data from nearly any source and from a wide variety of programs. In this lesson we will learn a little bit more about the External Data ribbon.

Import& Link
The Import& Link section allows you to bring in data from many different sources, including other Microsoft Office programs Or to be able to access the linked table manager to access and manage any tables that may be linked to other databases or Excel files. Saved Imports Allows you to retrieve information for a specific source many times. For example, if you extract information from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet on a regular basis, you can choose to save the import operation so you don‚Äôt need to set up the same import over and over again. Linked Table Manager This command is used to perform certain operations pertaining to any linked tables in your database. Excel The Excel command lets you import data from an Excel file or link to the data contained in a file. Access This command lets you import data from another Access file or link to the data contained in a file.

Export

In addition to being able to import data from a number of sources, Access can also export data to several different sources. Saved Exports If you frequently export data to a particular location or program, you can save the export operation for later use, thereby eliminating having to set up the export each time. Excel Export the data contained in an object to an Excel spreadsheet. Text File You can export the data contents from a database object to a plain text file that is usable on virtually any computing platform. XML File Xml Files use tagged data and can easily be used on the web or any application that allows the use of XML. XML is supported by a wide range of applications and is the standard data format for transporting or handling data outside of a database. PDF or XPS This option enables the contents of a database object to be distributed to others as a PDF or XPS files. This means you can see database objects without having the need for Access to be installed in every location.

Viewing Data
We have used Access so far in a simple way, usually opening only one or two objects at a time. In this lesson we will learn a bit more about the different views available in Access as well as some other viewing management options.

Using The View Menus

We have and will make use of the View menu throughout this manual. The View menu is located in The Home ribbon throughout Access and is different for each object you open. Table Datasheet view displays all data in a table in a columnar view. PivotTable and PivotChart views they allow you to quickly and graphically compare the values in one field with another. Design view lets you modify the properties of a table to make it contain and display the data you need. Form

Form view lets you view the form in such a way that you can enter data one record at a time into a table. Datasheet view is a way of showing you the table that the form references. Layout view is an intermediate step between Form view and Design view. It lets you adjust the location of objects in a form while still being able to see the data it contains. Design view lets you modify the look and feel of a form as well as add different controls to perform actions. Report

PivotTable and PivotChart allow you to quickly and graphically compare the values in one field with another. SQL (Structured Query Language) view is a way of viewing and modifying the background ‚Äòcode‚Äô used to make a query. SQL editing is beyond the scope of this manual. Design view lets you add and remove fields from the search as well as add criteria to retrieve more specific results. Many other options we will look into later are available in this view.

Using The View Icons
The View menu has a cousin present in the very bottom right-hand corner of the Access window. For example, viewing a table in Datasheet view will show the following buttons:

Relationships
The Relationships section of the ribbon is used to display some of the different characteristics that a database has:

Relationships Nearly every database that contains multiple tables also includes a relationship between the information contained in the database file. For example, if you work at a department store, each item likely has some department identification number associated with it (1, 2, 3, etc.). In the store database there is another table that lists the corresponding department name with a number (1 = ladies wear, 2 = furniture, 3 = kitchen & bath, etc.). The table of items and the table of departments share a relationship in that the values of one are related to the values of another. We will explore relationships later in this manual. Object Dependencies As you develop more relationships in your database and build more forms, reports, and queries, you will develop a large number of dependencies. That is, one object, such as a query, depends on many others in order to fulfil its job. Click this button to view these dependencies.

Analyze

The Analyze section of the ribbon is used to examine how your database is built and how will it will perform. Database performance, as well as the terminology and methodology behind it, is used mainly by database engineers. However, Access makes it easy to perform some optimizations to your data without you needing a PhD in computer science! Database Documenter The Database Documenter tool is used to thoroughly list every feature and property of a database object or group of objects.

Analyze Table This command launches the Table Analyzer Wizard. This tool works like the Analyze Performance command, but on a finer scale and one table at a time.

Move Data

The Move Data section of the ribbon is used to perform large scale move and split operations to a database. These commands are beyond the scope of this manual and should only be performed by IT professionals.

Access 2010: Part I

Understanding Access

In opening a database from a non secure location, we would encounter a warning stating that Access has prevented a file from being opened because of the security settings that have been enabled on your computer:

You might also run into other warnings that state Access cannot perform a certain action because a non-standard operation was encountered or some part of the database file seems to be missing. It is possible that the following warning might appear not because a problem was detected, but because a certain section of the database might not be fully constructed:

These warnings are designed to protect you, not scare you. Should you encounter messages like the ones above, think why it may have occurred. If you received the file from someone else, tell them you have encountered a problem before opening the file. If you are unsure about the file, contact your organization‚Äôs IT department for help; they may be able to diagnose your problem and provide a solution. It may even be that your security settings are a bit too high for this application (which is not always a bad thing). We will discuss what to do in situations like this in this lesson.

Enabling Content
If you are sure the file you are opening is safe, or you trust the person it came from, simply click the Enable Content button in the bar that appears under the ribbon:

Doing so will show the Trust In Office dialogue box: In the picture above, Access gave you a warning because it could not identify who made the file. This does not necessarily mean that it came from an untrustworthy source; perhaps whoever made the file did not bother to apply a digital signature (described in the next section) or security certificate. If you are sure the content is safe, simply click the Enable this content radio button and then click OK. The file will then open normally.

About Digital Signatures
Digital signatures serve the same purpose as a written signature or an embossed certificate: they identify who someone or what something is, and no two individual signatures are exactly the same. The same is true with digital signatures. Though the topic of signature application is a bit beyond the scope of this manual, the concept is fairly simple. If you are part of a corporate network that sends sensitive trade secrets via electronic means, you can apply digital signatures to the files that are created. If you use Access 2010 to organize supplier information, you can safely send information to another individual in your organization. Their computer will hold what is called a digital certificate which is designed to ‚Äòdecode‚Äô your signature. If your signature decodes properly, no problem ‚Äì the other user will then make use of the supplier information. However if your signature does not decode properly, the other user can choose to block content from you (or perhaps someone masquerading as you!). You can view and modify different aspects of Access‚Äô security via the Microsoft Office Access Trust Centre (described later in this lesson).

About Trusted Locations
Imagine you are an employee of a large company and you send and receive files every day. Access has been warning you that some files may contain a possible security threat because the sender could not be verified. However, you know the sender and know that they can be trusted. Therefore, instead of being warned every time you try to open a file from them (which can quickly become annoying), you can tell Access that files from a certain location can always be trusted. Trusted locations can include any location on your computer including shared folders, any other computer on your network, a server on your network, or some external data source across town or across the world!

Opening The Trust Center
All of the security features we have mentioned thus far are accessible through the Trust Centre. Let‚Äôs quickly explore the different sections and options available in each. To open the Trust Centre.

First Steps
Making a database might seem like a pretty big job, but taking the time to design one properly will save a lot of time down the road. You are exposed to databases everyday use them all the time probably without knowing it. In fact, you are likely in several, yourself! The easiest method of identifying yourself in day to day life is a simple handshake and saying ‚ÄúHello, my name is‚Ä¶‚Äù But you can‚Äôt really shake hands with a computer. Using your name, even your full name, isn‚Äôt a very good option either because there may be hundreds of people out there with exactly the same name as you. Therefore, you must be assigned some unique identifier, the most recognizable being your Social Security Number (SSN) or Social Insurance Number (SIN). No one else in the country has the same SSN as you. This practice holds true for databases, too. Earlier in this manual you may recall seeing the term ‚Äòprimary key‚Äô. Every row in a table should have at least one field that is unique from every other record. That field is usually a number, and the unique field is referred to as the primary key. It is not imperative to have a primary key, but it makes the design of the database much easier and eliminates the possibility of duplicate data (which does nothing but confuse the issue!) It also allows a database program to (in most cases) search faster and more efficiently. Therefore, it is good practice to have a primary key for every table you make.

Access 2010: Part I

Understanding Access

Let‚Äôs quickly review what we know about databases: they are made up of tables, and in each table are several records (or rows) of data. Every record is made up of one or more fields, and every record in a table is different from every other record because of the unique primary key. Knowing this, and with the knowledge of the commands we learned so far, we are ready to start making databases! For the remainder of this manual, let‚Äôs pretend that you are Bugs Rabbit, CEO of an upstart animation company, Warner Cousins. You want to use Access 2010 to monitor the expenses made by you and your employees.

Planning A Database
Before you start using Access to create a database, take the time to answer a few questions: ‚Ä¢	 Why do you need a database? You want to keep track of the expenses made by you and your employees. ‚Ä¢	 Who will be using the database? Any employee of Warner Cousins will have access to this database. ‚Ä¢	 What kind of data would be extracted from the database? Total expenses of the company, total expenses by each employee, expenses by each category. Once you have answered these questions, it is time to decide how to design the tables for your database. What fields of data do you need? What data types will the fields need to be? What tables would be important? Which fields will go in which table, and do the placements make sense?

Understanding Access

Next comes the planning of relationships between the data. A big list of numbers doesn‚Äôt mean much by itself, but when constructed based on other data, it becomes meaningful. And finally, make sure that you talk to everyone who will be using the database will be able to get the data they need. Let‚Äôs examine some of the details. You will obviously need an expense table that contains at least the following: who made the purchase, what did they purchase, how much was it, and when did they purchase it? The payroll department already has a listing of the people who work for you: ‚Ä¢	 SIN (or company ID #) ‚Ä¢	 Name ‚Ä¢	 Address ‚Ä¢	 Phone Number ‚Ä¢	 Company Position The database now should have two tables: an expenses table and an employee table. Now, there needs to be some sort of link between the two tables. You could use the name of each person, but that may become confusing, especially if your company grows into the hundreds. There is another option, however. You can use the SIN (or company ID) of each employee to tie their purchase to their personal information. In database design, your most powerful tool is not the computer, but rather a piece of paper and a pencil (and a big eraser). Not only can you easily change the information you might need, but you can also visualize the information. Consider the following diagram, based on the paragraph above:

It might not look like much, but we have a database. It contains fields, records, a primary key for each record in each table, and a relationship between the data. We can see that employee 2 has made two purchases, and employee 1 only one. This might seem silly for an example of this size; why not just say Elmer Funn instead of an employee ID? As mentioned above, this becomes impractical if your organization grows. Imagine that your company has grown to employ thousands of people with hundreds of expenses a day ‚Äì that becomes a pile of data in a big hurry! You might employ three or four Elmer Funns by now, so using a unique number to identify each employee becomes much more practical.

Basic Terminology
Let‚Äôs take a look at the terminology used in database-speak, starting with the basics. Consider the following diagram:

Let‚Äôs Look At Each Piece Of The Database. Field A field is the smallest piece of a database; that is, one specific piece of information like a number, a word, a date, a picture, or a reference for some other piece of data. Each column you see in the diagram would all be the same data type; that is, one column of data would all be numbers. Record A record is a collection of one or more fields together in a row. (In a real database, you would not count the word ‚ÄòRecord‚Äô as depicted in the diagram ‚Äì this is just to help visualize the concept.) Table A table is comprised of one or more records. Each table also has a unique name. Database A database is comprised of one or more tables. Each database is also given a unique name. Form A form is a tool that is used to easily and accurately enter data into a table. A form presents one record of a database at a time to a user, or allows a user to enter data into the database one record at a time.

Access 2010: Part I Query

Understanding Access

A query is just like a question you ask the database. There are two types of queries: select and action. A select query will extract and display data based on criteria you provide. An action query will find all data relevant to your query and perform some sort of operation on it. A query can be performed on one or more tables in a database. Report A report presents the data found by a query. A report can be formatted to show summaries, calculations, charts, and more based on the data returned by a query. Access takes the report one step further by letting you organize and format a report into a sleek, professional document suitable for printing, exporting, or e-mailing. This might seem like a lot to remember, but don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì this terminology will be used heavily throughout this manual and soon it will be second nature!

What Is A Primary Key?
A Primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record in a table. An ID number of code often serves as the Primary key because this type of value is always different for each record. Access‚Äôs

Access 2010: Part I

Understanding Access

Primary keys are especially flexible, because you can specify any field, not just the first field in the table. ‚ÄòACCESS‚Äô automatically creates an index for a table‚Äôs primary key. A Primary key is similar to a dbase unique index except that ‚ÄòACCESS‚Äô automatically keeps the index on the Primary key current and uses it to search and sort records. You can also create indexes for other fields you search or sort on often.

What Is Unique Index?
For example, suppose you had the personnel records for a large company stored on a database. There are over 50,000 employees within the company and it is necessary for you to find different employees record so that they can be updated. If the records were not indexed, every time you try to find the employee record for ‚ÄòMr Smith‚Äô you will need to read from the beginning of the database until you find ‚ÄòMr Smith‚Äô. This operation could take hours to complete. However, if the records were stored or indexed in alphabetical order then finding the record for ‚ÄòMr. Smith‚Äô would be a great deal easier. What if they are 3 ‚ÄòMr. Smith‚Äô? Which record would be the correct one? This highlights the reason why you should try and make your index (primary key) unique, so that every record is different and can be found easily. Staff numbers would be the ideal field to create as an index, because it is unique, no two employees‚Äô numbers are ever the same. Therefore, if you need to find ‚ÄòMr. Smith‚Äôs record and you know his staff number them the record could be located in a matter of seconds rather than hours.

Field Properties & Validation
‚ÄòACCESS‚Äô automatically validates values based on a field data type; for example ‚ÄòACCEESS‚Äô will not allow text in a numeric field. You can set more specific rules for data validation rules.

When Should You Validate Data?
Data should be validated: ‚Ä¢	 When you want to cut down the amount of errors that can occur in data entry ‚Ä¢	 When you want data to be entered in a specific format only ‚Ä¢	 With fixed length (only xxx amount of characters can be entered) For example if you were asking someone a question about their date of birth, you could set up a validation rule that only allowed them to enter their data in a specific format i.e. Day/Month/Year, and only allowed them to enter a date which makes them over the age of 18. This will ensure validity of data and cut down the number of errors made.

Setting Field Properties
In the lower portion of the table window, you can set properties for the current field. For example, you can set the size of text or numeric fields. This is also where you define validation rules and default values to assist in the data entry and prevent mistakes in your data.

Understanding Access

The Concept Of Normalisation
Data values should not be stored twice. If they are, it is a waste of space and more importantly, leads to updates only being applied to some of the copies of the value. Each record is a collection of data items, which have some unique key. In any one record, the data items can only have one value for each key. If a formal system has a set of repeating entries on one form, then each repeating entry becomes a record in a table. Some business applications can be implemented using only one table, for example a stock file of a mailing database. Many other applications use several tables; stock monitoring with records of purchase orders being delivered and despatches being sent out. The correct system for an internal telephone directory giving departments, employees, rooms and extension numbers needs six tables to cope with such concepts as one room having more than one telephone extensions or two employees sharing the same extension. End-users require an understanding of these concepts before they can design systems, which are capable of solving a problem. The target of the developer should be that, other people could use system without hours of explanation, or volumes of documentation THIS IS SELDOM ACHIEVED ‚Äì usually due to lack of system design. The data that is to be stored in tables need to be thought about. One factor that needs to be taken into consideration when deciding what tables will be needed is the reality of the system. How many repeating lines mean a new table is needed? A simple example of this is a list of companies and their telephone numbers. There could be a field for the switch board number, a fax number and an emergency number. This means that we can use one record per company, with three telephone number fields. If one company has fifty external telephone lines then we should NOT allocate fifty field for the numbers in one record; we should start a new table with one field for each telephone number, and another filed to link the telephone number table to the company table. WE do not normally want to repeat the company name in the company name in the telephone number table, as this would be a repetition. If each company has a unique identifier, then this can be stored in the telephone number table. We have already mentioned that each table normally has a unique key ‚ÄòACCESS‚Äô allows the key to be constructed from two fields such that the combination of values from the two fields is unique. It is NOT compulsory to have a key for a title; the existence of a key serves more that one purpose though.

Normalisation Techniques
‚Ä¢	 The steps in Normalising data are: ‚Ä¢	 Convert the source data into a list of attributes; ‚Ä¢	 Put repeating groups of data into separate structures; ‚Ä¢	 Put data that is only dependent on part of the key into separate structures; ‚Ä¢	 Put data that is dependent on other non-key data into separate structures; ‚Ä¢	 Combine structures with identical keys.
The following source document will be used to illustrate the effect of each step.

SALES ORDER RECORD Order No. Customer No. Invoice Address: Order Details Product Code Description QTY Price Delivery Data Order Date: Customer Name: Consignee Address: Order Value Priority Sales Person

Delivery Instruction:

Special Instruction:

Understanding Access

Put fields which are only dependent on part of the key into separate structures (Second Normal Form) This step is also called ‚Äòremoving partial dependencies‚Äô. The description attributes in the extracted group is only dependent on the product code part of the key, not the order No. So that is extracted to a new group. Its primary key is product code. In simple terms this is saying that the description of a product will always be the same, so why not hold it once under the product code, rather that repeat it every time it is ordered.

Access 2010: Part I (Third Normal Form (TNF)). This step is known as ‚Äòremoving mutual dependencies‚Äô.

Understanding Access

The fields ‚ÄòCustomer Address‚Äô, and ‚ÄòInvoice Address‚Äô are only dependent on the customer number. They are extracted to a separate group with Customer Number as the primary key. Customer Number needs to remain in the original data group as a foreign key to provide a link to the extracted data. Again, in simple terms, the reasoning is that if the ‚ÄòCustomer Address‚Äô and ‚ÄòInvoice Address‚Äô will always be the same, hold them only once with the master details of the customer. The foreign key is marked with an ‚Äò*‚Äô. Order No.	 Order No.	 Product Code	 Description	 Invoice Address Customer No. Customer Name

		Product Code Order Date			 Sales Person	 *Customer No.	 Quantity	 Price	 Delivery Date

Consignee Address Delivery Instruction Special Instruction Priority

Key Values
‚ÄòACCESS‚Äô ensures that no two records in the same table can have the same key. If we use a ‚Äòpart number‚Äô to identify a line of stock, then this must be kept unique. If two different lines of stock had the same key, then chaos could be caused. The key also creates a sequence for the records. However, the user should not try to use values for a key to sequence a report. The data can be presented in different sequence in different printouts without using any keys. The key also provides quick access to a record, which is important if there are hundreds of records in a file. This feature is used frequently by ‚ÄòACCESS‚Äô when the user is interacting with more than one table at once, via a form, a report or a key.

Choosing A Key
Sometimes the choice of a field for a key is self-evident, as with example such as Employee Details (Payroll number) or stock file (Part Number). If the table is a list of companies, then the choice is not so obvious. If the companies were customers, then a Sales Ledger system would specify an account number for each. If they are a mix of useful contacts such as Bank, Inland Revenue, Software support, Consultant and so on, then there is no obvious key.

Understanding Access

In this situation, an artificial key needs to be created. The old fashioned way to do this was to sue some letters of the company name, a letter to give their relationship to our organisation to our organisation and some geographical reference. This style of solution is now largely discredited, and it is more common to use an artificial numbering system such as A001, A002 and so on. The length of the code should be as short as possible, but providing enough possible values to cope with any predictable number of records. An alphabetical key provide many more possible values than numeric, but care should be taken to avoid problems such as A 1 not being the same as A1 or A 1. Sometimes it is desirable to use two fields for a key. If we wish to keep records of daily usage of pool cars, then we could use the combination of the car registration numbers and the date. This would not permit the storage of two records for the same car for the same day though. A system to record quality wines in stock will need to have a list of the wines, and then a second table indicating the number of wines in stock for each year. In this case, the key to the wine table could be vineyard number, and the key to the second table would be the combination of the vineyard number and the year. It is always possible to create a new field to act a key in one table, and store the other fields as non-key data items.

Saving in Access

Section 3	 Saving in Access
By the end of this section you will be able to ‚Ä¢	 Save your objects ‚Ä¢	 Save objects as different object types ‚Ä¢	 Save your database as earlier versions ‚Ä¢	 Set file and object properties

Saving in Access
Much of the file management functionality of Access takes place in the background and automatically saves most changes you make to a database. When Access does not save something for you automatically, you will be prompted asking if you want to save the changes to a particular object. However, Access does give you a bit of flexibility when it comes to saving different objects. We will explore this saving functionality in this lesson.

Using The Save As Options
Access gives you two commands to choose from: Save Object as and Save database as (to save database in another format.) Let‚Äôs look at each of the options.

Save Object As
Most things in Access are saved automatically, but you can perform a manual save of a particular database object. For example, consider the Employees table of the Northwind sample database:
